Dear Madam Secretary of State:
It was wonderful catching up with you in Copenhagen. The opportunity to interact with President Obama and you at the
very last minute to salvage the Copenhagen Accord at the US-BASIC Summit Meeting was fantastic and unforgettable for
me personally. I am still reeling from that historic 75 minutes!!
With greetings for Xmas and best wishes for the New Year,

Unable to sustain solid growth, Pakistan's economy is
teetering on the brink of collapse, with one-third of the
population living below the poverty line. S. Akbar Zaidi
writes in a new brief that Pakistan's economic
instability stems in large part from low government
revenue due to the elite's use of tax evasions,
loopholes, and exemptions. Without tax reform,
Pakistan will continue to run an unsustainable debt
and be forced to rely on Western donors for bailouts.

2004 to 2005 he was a visiting
professor at Johns Hopkins

International Studies (SAIS) and

Fascell Democracy Fellow at the

Democracy.
Zaidi's twelfth book, Military,
Civil Society and
Democratization in Pakistan, is
to be published by Vanguard
Press, Lahore in October 2010.
Policy Recommendations:
• Eliminate exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million
citizens pay any income tax, and the country's tax-to-GDP ratio is just 9
percent. By eliminating tax exemptions for the rich, politicians can fund
essential social services.
• Increase tax revenue. Pakistani legislators must build a consensus to tax the
rich and elite if they want to match growth rates in nearby developing
countries.
• Spend more on development. Pakistan has spent twice as much on defense
during peacetime as it has on education and health combined—this needs to
change.
• Stop the bailouts. Donor countries must put conditions on funding and
should emphasize tax and economic reform to help Pakistan develop long-
term economic plans for sustainable growth.
""Pakistan's lack of a proper tax and revenue regime has resulted in high rates of tax
evasion, burdening the country with unsustainable debt and undermining its
development priorities,"" writes Zaidi. ""The key to the country's economic prosperity—
even its survival—is a far-reaching program of tax reform.""

BRIEF
SEPTEMBER 2010
Pakistan's Roller-Coaster Economy:
Tax Evasion Stifles Growth
S AKBAR ZAIDI
Visiting Scholar, South Asia Program
SUMMARY
Over the last sixty years, Pakistan's economy has seen severe ups and downs. Once considered a model for
other developing nations, Pakistan has been unable to sustain solid growth. Furthermore, a third of its
population now lives below the poverty line, and its literacy rate is abysmally low.
Pakistan's economic instability stems in large part from low government revenue resulting from the elite's
use of tax evasions, loopholes, and exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million citizens pay
any income taxes, and the country's tax-to-GDP ratio is only 9 percent. Tax evasion means fewer resources are
available for essential social services.
Pakistan spends too much on defense and too little on development: It has spent twice as much on defense
during peacetime as it has on education and health combined.
The government knows how to increase its revenue through tax reform, but the rich and powerful have
resisted such measures for fear of lowering their own incomes.
Without sufficient revenue the government will continue to be burdened with an unsustainable debt. It needs
to end tax exemptions for the wealthy and develop broader, long-term economic plans for sustainable growth.
In the past, the United States and other Western nations have come to Pakistan's rescue by paying off debts
and funding development initiatives. Pakistan's elite has no reason to support reform as long as these bailouts
come with no conditions attached.

Once heralded as a beacon for other develop-
ing countries, Pakistan's economy bears little
worthy of emulation today. For years now,
it has fluctuated wildly between periods of
impressive growth and dismal slumps. While
political competition between the mili-
tary and civilian politicians has been partly
responsible for this instability, Pakistan's lack
of a proper tax and revenue regime has result-
ed in high rates of tax evasion, burdening the
country with unsustainable debt and under-
mining its development priorities. Pakistan's
politics may recently have taken a turn for
the better with the strengthening of demo-
cratic institutions and the judiciary, but the
key to the country's economic prosperity—
even its survival—is a far-reaching program
of tax reform.

economic success ""that so far has been
reached by only one other populous country,
the United States."" A year later the London
Times struck a similar enthusiastic note,
saying that ""the survival and development
of Pakistan is one of the most remarkable
examples of state and nation building in the
post-war period.""
Forty years later, the press was offering
a very different bouquet of sobriquets to
describe Pakistan. International newspapers
and magazines called it ""the most danger-
ous place in the world,"" a ""failed state,"" and a
‘`rogue state with a nuclear arsenal,"" to name
just a few. Only a few decades before, several
far less developed countries, such as South
Korea, Malaysia, China and India, were con-
sidered far less likely than Pakistan to survive,
much less thrive. Today, all of those countries
and others have surged ahead of Pakistan
economically.
Pakistan didn't fall behind because it
stood still; rather, its economic history spans
six decades of roller coaster ups and downs.
The first decade, 1947-1958, was one of
""settling down,"" in which the new country
comprising East and West Pakistan emerged
from British India. The second period,
1958-1968, was marked by the rule of
General Muhammad Ayub Khan and is now
known as the Decade of Development for its
high growth rates. Accompanying those high
growth rates, however, were high income and
regional inequality, which contributed to the

secession of East Pakistan and the war that
gave birth to Bangladesh.
In 1971 a new Pakistan emerged under
the government of the left-of-center Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto. Nationalization of private busi-
nesses and public sector—led development
were the norm for the new regime. Growth
was relatively low compared to the decades
before and after, but adequate under the
dire and constrained circumstances of the
time. Following Bhutto's ouster in 1977,
General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq inaugurated
Pakistan's fourth ""era,"" ruling until 1988. Zia's
era saw the return of high growth rates, but
it also saw the role of the military increase
greatly in the economy, politics, foreign pol-
icy and in society more generally. Zia's death
brought a period of active civilian politics and
electioneering. ""Democracy"" is perhaps too
generous a term for this process. There were

PAKISTAN'S ROLLER-COASTER ECONOMY: TAX EVASION STIFLES GROWTH
numerous governments between 1988 and
1999, and economic performance nosedived
as it never had before. From October 1999
until to 2008, Pakistan was ruled by its third
military dictator, General Pervez Musharraf.
Pakistan's economy grew again during this
period, thanks to debt restructuring and large
doses of aid and assistance. Several factors
gave rise to these benevolent circumstances,
the most important of which was the inter-
national political atmosphere following 9/11.
Since 2008, a democratically elected coalition
government has been forced to deal with the
collateral damage caused by its predecessor's
politics and economics.
Despite the rise-and-fall pattern of GDP
growth over the last fifty years, Pakistan's econ-
omy has grown on average by more than 5 per-
cent per year. This is no mean achievement.
While many comparable countries in the region
have also grown at similar or higher rates,
Pakistan has the unenviable distinction of
inconsistent growth. Other countries such as
Malaysia, South Korea and, of course, China
have all had much higher growth rates over the
same period, and they generally have been able
to sustain those rates over decades. India too,
which had a far slower growth rate than
Pakistan's from about 1947 to the 1980s, has
not only improved its performance fundamen-
tally over the last twenty years, but has also
grown consistently for the past two decades,
leaving Pakistan far behind. Even Bangladesh,
once dismissed as a ""basket case"" by arrogant
Pakistani economists and planners, has recently
had several years of stable growth despite politi-
cal uncertainty. What distinguishes Pakistan
from these other countries is its inability to sus-
tain good performance for more than five or
six years. While India, China, Malaysia,
Vietnam, and numerous other countries east of
Pakistan have now emerged as regional and
global economic and political powerhouses,
Pakistan has barely stumbled along.
EXPLAINING THE
UP-AND-DOWN PATTERN
Is Pakistan and its economy forever doomed
to instability and stuttering growth? Why has
Pakistan's economy been so troubled? Does it
have deep rooted structural features that make
it peculiarly susceptible to crises?
A major explanation of Pakistan's volatile
economic history is the state's poor revenue
generation. Low tax revenues are in turn
caused by tax evasion and a legal structure
that allows for too many exemptions and
loopholes. Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio is just
The key to Pakistanis economic prosperity
even its survivai—is a far-reaching program
of tax reform.
9 percent. This figure puts Pakistan in the
155th position out of 179 nations on the
Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic
Freedom. Only oil-rich countries that impose
few taxes perform worse. Fewer than three
million of Pakistan's population of 175 mil-
lion pay any income tax. A huge and buoyant
informal (underground) economy, estimated
to be anywhere from 30 to 80 percent of the
real economy, goes untaxed and unrecorded.
These are the attributes of a rentier state,
except that Pakistan lacks the wealth-produc-
ing oil and gas reserves normally associated
with such states.
Clearly, tax evasion and the inability of the
regime to tax the informal sector mean that
it has fewer resources for education, health,
infrastructure and development. A perennial
debt crisis has affected Pakistan's economy
largely because its expenditures, many of
which are justified, are well in excess of rev-
enue, forcing the country to go to foreign (and
domestic) borrowers. This indebtedness affects
issues of political economy at the domestic
and international level.

For example, the severe debt burden had
been the single most important attribute of
Pakistan's economy through the 1990s. Overall
outstanding debt was equal to GDP, and for-
eign debt servicing alone in 2001-2002 was
as much as 10 percent of GDP. Excessive tax
evasion was the primary cause of this.
After 9/11, however, the Musharraf regime
was able to sign agreements with bilateral and
multinational donors to write off or resched-
ule huge amounts of this debt, giving them
unprecedented fiscal space. This fiscal free-
dom was the main reason the economy turned
around so sharply. Growth rose to 7.5 percent
in 2003-2004 until maxing out the follow-
ing year at 9 percent, the highest level in two
decades. The fiscal deficit was near its lowest
level in almost two decades, remittances were at
historic highs, and exports crossed the $17 bil-
lion mark for the first time and showed signs of
further growth. By 2006-2007, domestic debt
had fallen to 30 percent of GDP, and foreign
debt servicing was less than 5 percent of GDP.
The government claimed that the economy
had rebounded, that there had been a ""turn-
around,"" and that good times of high growth
and high human development had returned.
Even the stock market soared to unprecedented
levels, shattering records weekly.
Moreover, at some point between 2002
and 2004, Pakistan joined those ninety
or so countries that the United Nations
Development Programme's (UNDP) Human
Development Report (HDR) puts in the cat-
egory of ""Medium Human Development.""
From the time of the first annual HDR in
1990, Pakistan had consistently been classi-
fied as one of the forty or so countries in the
""Low Human Development"" category. (By
comparison, both India and Bangladesh both

moved from the low to the medium category
in the late 1990s, well before Pakistan.) Many
thought that, after years of bei% considered
a ""middle income country with low human
development,"" Pakistan had at last moved into
a category that better reflected its economic
and social characteristics.
Following the 2002-2007 period, Pakistan
seemed set on a course for sustained economic
improvement. Yet despite exceptional and
unanimous support from the international
donor community, little political opposition
at home, and uninterrupted political stability
and control of government (in sharp contrast
to the eleven changes of government between
1985-1999), these few years of remarkable
growth quickly unraveled.
REASONS FOR
UNRAVELING GROWTH
ABSENCE OF LONG-TERM
PLANNING AND INVESTMENT
The boom of the Musharraf years unraveled so
quickly because it was built on false founda-
tions: largely, consumer-led growth and invest-
ments in the speculative sector (real estate and
the stock market) fueled by remittances and
foreign aid. What was missing was a longer-
term strategy to guide the money being sent to
Pakistan into more productive sectors. Banks
awash with excess liquidity were all too eager
to feed the growing middle class with cheap
loans to finance their consumption. This
consumer-led boom did prompt the manufac-
turing sector to ramp up production to meet
increasing demand for cars, motorcycles and
other items, but it also helped create a bubble,
which eventually burst.
The budgetary maneuvering space created
by aid and debt write-offs did enable the gov-
ernment to spend money on much needed
infrastructure. The resulting new roads and
communication networks helped Pakistan,
although they couldn't keep up with the
increase in demand. The extent of the consumer
boom had caught the government off guard,
leaving them unable to provide the resources
that the growing middle class required. The
government's inability to meet the huge spurt
in demand for electric power, for example,
resulted in extensive power shortages which
have hurt manufacturing and industry.
THE ROUNDABOUT OF POLITICS
The governments of Generals Ayub (1958-
1968), Zia (1977-1988), and Musharraf
(1999-2008) were all, by definition, authori-
tarian military dictatorships, though each had
its own particular hue. Western powers sup-
ported all three of them, but for very different
reasons. All three were relatively benign com-
pared to the ruthless Latin American dictator-
ships of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s.
One could, moreover, say that Musharraf's
rule was ""softer"" than the first two military
dictatorships, with the former even being
forced to follow the Constitution on numer-
ous occasions. Nevertheless, the absence of
political participation by the major parties
marked all three regimes.
A key factor separating Pakistan's military
dictatorships from those of Africa or Latin
America is their relatively short life spans.
None of them managed to successfully pass off
the baton to a military successor. Once politi-
cal pressure began to emerge, the Ayub and
Musharraf regimes crumbled (Zia was killed
in a plane crash) because they excluded key
civilian political actors.
While India, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and
numerous other countries east of Pakistan
have now emerged as regional and global
economic and political powerhouses,
Pakistan has barely stumbled along.

When civilians regained power, they tended
to blame the military for Pakistan's problems,
regardless of whether such blame was justi-
fied. The threat of yet another military coup
hung over these civilian governments, weak-
ening them and thus creating the rationale for
the military to intervene. The extremely short
tenures of Pakistan's elected governments left
them no opportunities to craft long-term
strategies.
The experiences of Pakistan's neighbor
India provide an important point of compari-
son here. The Indian electorate rejected the
""India shining"" slogans of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP)—led government of 1999-2004
in favor of a Congress-led government. Yet
despite the intense antagonism between the
Congress Party and the BJP, the political tran-
sition was a smooth one. Of course, India is a
mature democracy whereas Pakistan's has had
little opportunity to grow, but the example
nevertheless shows that smooth political tran-
sitions and high growth rates are not entirely
foreign to the region.
Pakistan's frequent regime changes aren't
the only reason that the country has never
been able to engage in long-term planning. It
is also possible that the system itself, regardless
of whether civilians or the military are at the
helm, encourages the rentier mentality. Recent
events related to profiteers hoarding wheat
and sugar, for example, suggest that corrup-
tion continues to enjoy support from key
elements of Pakistan's society. Such systemic
Pakistan'o' poky makers and polliticians
need to understand that they cannot go
on Iliviing on b rrowed money forever.

PAKISTAN'S ROLLER-COASTER ECONOMY: TAX EVASION STIFLES GROWTH
corruption severely distorts the signaling func-
tions of markets, and thus efficient develop-
ment as well.
LOW EMPHASIS ON HUMAN CAPITAL
One of the paradoxes of Pakistan's economy
is its periodic achievement of high rates of
growth despite being burdened with poor
social indicators. Pakistan's economic and
social profile from 1993 to 2003 looked more
like that of an African country, combining an
abysmally low literacy rate with a skyrocketing
population, poor treatment of women, and
endemic poverty. Economic growth has done
little to ameliorate Pakistan's social problems.
One reason why investment in human
capital has been so low is that defense expen-
diture has been so high. In peacetime, military
expenditure has exceeded 7 percent of GDP,
twice the amount allocated to education
and health combined. With debt service and
defense taking up as much as 75 percent of
the government's annual budget throughout
the 1980s and 1990s, very little remained for
development.
In the age of globalization, such failure to
invest in human capital bodes ill for Pakistan's
future. While Pakistan's neighbor India, by
contrast, has successfully diversified into ser-
vices such as information technology, Pakistan
has failed to do so, despite sharing one of
India's biggest advantages: a large English-
speaking population.
One of the fundamental reasons Pakistan's
elite has failed to invest in human capital is its
lack of appreciation for the idea of the public
good. Short-term, narrow and selfish interests,
whether class-, institution- or ethnic-based,
override the common good. It's hard to under-
stand why this behavior persists, and hence
even more difficult to ""solve"" the problems it
creates, but at least recognizing it is the first
step toward a solution.
TAX EVASION—THE CORE ISSUE?
There are at least two sides to Pakistan's overin-
vestment in defense (and thus its underinvest-
ment in development). On the demand side,
defense overinvestment derives from the per-
Pakistan's lack of a proper tax and revenue
regime has resulted in high rates of tax
e asion, burdening the country with
unsustainable debt and undermining its
development priorities.
ception that ""national insecurity"" is a defining
feature of the Pakistani state. This is both a
cause and an effect of the military's dominance
of the country's political economy. But there
is a supply side to this issue, too. Essentially,
if government revenues were higher, Pakistan
might be able to fund both defense and devel-
opment at a level more conducive to national
well-being. The question remains: Why aren't
government revenues higher?
The main culprit is tax evasion. Pakistan's
tax evasion problem is caused by three things:
poor legal frameworks and bureaucratic capa-
bilities with regard to revenue extraction; cor-
ruption in the form of a predatory class that
privileges certain sectors and vested interests
with unjustified tax ""exemptions""; and elites
who cut deals with the state to avoid taxa-
tion, made possible by an anemic agriculture
income tax (agriculture makes up 22 per-
cent of Pakistan's GDP, but only 1 percent
of its tax revenue). Research suggests that
with a more extensive, transparent, progres-
sive and equitable tax structure, government
revenue could easily double, thus closing the
huge gap between defense and development
expenditures.
The fact that Pakistan—the world's 26th
richest country in purchasing power parity—

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773013 Date: 08/31/2015
does so poorly when it comes to revenue gen-
eration suggests that deep structural factors are
at work. A small elite comprised of the mili-
tary, land owners, and the rising urban upper
and middle classes, is loath to give up any of
its wealth (some of which is illegally accumu-
lated). Even the apparently forward-looking,
enlightened, and modernist military regime
headed by General Pervez Musharraf failed to
restructure Pakistan's tax regime, and backed
down in the face of a massive popular revolt to
his proposal to register traders and shop own-
ers. It's unlikely that an elected government
will do any better. Given their typically short
political tenures, elected governments are too
fearful of daggers in the night to propose bold,
politically unpopular solutions. And despite
their loud protestations to the contrary, oppo-
sition parties would be no more likely to
champion reform if they came into power.
Thus it isn't that the military and civilian
elite of Pakistan don't know how to fix the
problem; it's that their short-sightedness and
penchant for self-preservation make them not
want to. Their certain knowledge that ""the
West will never let Pakistan fail"" also gives the
elite tremendous confidence in the status quo.
CONCLUSIONS
Is there anything that can be done? Is Pakistan's
economy fated to hover perpetually near the
edge of crisis? Perhaps not. Some positive
trends suggest that some of Pakistan's liabili-
ties may be receding. One must keep in mind,
of course, that predicting Pakistan's economic
and political future is a game whose rules are
extremely uncertain.
Despite the uncertainties, two observa-
tions about the post-Musharraf period stand
out. First, while Pakistan's economic growth
rate dipped considerably in 2008-2009 to
1.2 percent, it rebounded to about 4 percent
the following year. This figure, although still
low compared to earlier years, is respectable
in a time of increasing internal terrorism and
global slowdown, and it suggests that even in
difficult times, economic growth is possible in
Pakistan. It may also suggest that the under-
lying structures in the economy have shifted
much as they did two decades ago. In sharp
contrast to its dismal performance in the
1990s and the period after Pakistan's nuclear
tests in 1998, Pakistan's economy may have
ascended to a higher, more stable plane. If
Pakistan can perform so well when the rest of
the world is reeling from a global recession,
then a more forceful economic policy might
produce truly exceptional results.
The second observation concerns the
maturing of the political process, which sug-
gests the possibility of greater continuity, a key
requirement for economic stability. Despite
numerous attacks, challenges and tensions
from within, Pakistan's democracy has man-
aged to weather the past two-and-a-half years
fairly comfortably—so far. An assertive judi-
ciary, a supportive civilian opposition and
a reticent, contemplative military have all
helped to strengthen and deepen the political
process of democracy.
Ever mindful of uncertainties, and keep-
ing these two observations in mind, it is clear
that the government will have to make several

decisions to break out of the high-low cycle
and place the economy on a more stable foot-
ing. First, it must undertake a comprehensive
revision of the tax regime if it is ever to seri-
ously tackle development, particularly in the
social sectors. This can only happen if there
is a political consensus to tax the rich. Given
that many of the rich are elected policy mak-
ers, this means that the elite will have to look
past their strong, vested interests in the status
quo. Forging such a consensus will require
not just technocratic innovations but politi-
cal settlements in which members of the civil-
ian, political and military elites come to some
form of agreement on a long-term strategy for
Pakistan's political and economic future. The
international community has a role to play,
too. Multilateral agencies, the United States,
and other countries must carefully reconsider
their aid and loan packages to avoid creating a
moral hazard. If large amounts of foreign assis-
tance are always at hand when Pakistan nears a
crisis, then Pakistan's elite will have no incen-
tive to look past the short term.
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
o Pakistani policy makers and politicians need
to understand that they cannot go on living
on borrowed money forever. They must
build a partisan consensus to tax the rich
and the elite (mostly themselves) if they
wish to• bring Pakistan up to speed with
other developing countries in the region.
O They must eliminate unjustifiable tax
exemptions and preferences given to sec-
tors or individuals, and institute in its place
a broader policy that taxes earnings and
wealth, not activities.
O Pakistan must improve documentation of
the economy in order to better estimate
taxable income and increase government
revenue.
O Pakistan's leadership needs to rise above
party politics and, with the advice and con-
sent of a supportive opposition, implement
a broader economic framework.
O Donor countries need to recognize that
they have bailed out Pakistan too often.
They should instead pursue a ""do more""
approach, emphasizing tax and economic
policies that can harness Pakistan's huge
underreported revenue potential.

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

• France hits back at EU after accusations Sarkozy government acted 'like Nazis' in treatment of Roma
According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'
Time limit: Carla with husband Nicolas Sarkozy. She claims one term as French president will be enough for him
Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book
In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Days of rage: the Tea Party & America's right

About the author

published in the New York Times, the Daily Beast, the Nation, the Huffington Post, Salon, and other publications. He is

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of ""Republican Gomorrah"", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
""He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility"" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. ""These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country"", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. ""Good luck Obama"", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. ""We outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay
former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a ""racist"". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were ""no red states"" and no ""conservative America"". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain ""divisive"" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by ""partisans"". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could ""bridge the partisan divide"". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies ""fifth columnists"" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become ""a liberal Reagan who can reunite America"". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: ""I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views."" Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see ""Barack Obama, the fallen messiah"", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the ""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a ""civilian national security force"", Taitz told me she ""realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her ""greatest supporter"", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% ""weren't
sure"". ""Obama should be in the Big House"", Taitz shrieked to me, ""not the White House!""
When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the ""Other"", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the ""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. ""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama"",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, ""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world"", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party ""Patriots"" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
""real America"". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying ""ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters."" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of ""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.
Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of ""economic freedom"". She claimed the Democratic ""cap-
and-trade"" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for ""socialism"" (though she admitted her family ""used to hustle over the border"" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for ""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death panels"" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as ""the lie of 2009"". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. ""President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there"", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: ""Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual."" He thundered, ""The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!""
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.
The enemy
The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: ""One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas."" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""terror-management theory"" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer ""grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns."" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's ""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"", a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day"", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, ""Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"" from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: ""I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us."" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: ""Death
lives!""
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party ""Patriots"". During a broadcast of ""Fox and Friends"", Beck opined that Obama
""has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture."" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's ""socialist"" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
""Obama money"" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to
Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that ""Obama's SS"" was being
trained across inner-city America.
In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. ""Trust me"", Beck said,
""Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so."" (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: ""Whitewater is about healthcare."")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. ""Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know"", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. ""He's opened our eyes to so much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. ""We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was"", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as ""required reading"" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that ""coercive taxation"" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of ""amours"" with ""old women,"" and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that
""powerful influences congregating in the United States"" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.
Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,
""conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.""
From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-
communism for obvious financial purposes.""
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the
radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared
entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea
Party ""suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""
The descent
Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots
celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his
mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply"", Mack warned, ""you control the
people. And that's the first step to slavery.""
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.
Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established
figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals, secret policemen, rats."" With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by
cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since
1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform
was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance
plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in
healthcare negotiations. ""He's a big hero now in the pro-life community"", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. ""Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power.""
To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to
Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out
virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""
On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the
civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot"", eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel
Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.
With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and take these fascists down"", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of
an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""
The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House
floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In
response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. ""The motion to commit does
not support life"", Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" Heckling from the Republican side
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, ""Baby
killer!"" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a
right-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows"",
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them and
run to break again."" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and
Arizona had been shattered.
Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative
Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged
activists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper
attacks.
After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence
thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded the
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of ""Republican Gomorrah"", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
""He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility"" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. ""These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country"", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. ""Good luck Obama"", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. ""We outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay

former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a ""racist"". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were ""no red states"" and no ""conservative America"". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain ""divisive"" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by ""partisans"". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could ""bridge the partisan divide"". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies ""fifth columnists"" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become ""a liberal Reagan who can reunite America"". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: ""I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views."" Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see ""Barack Obama, the fallen messiah"", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the ""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a ""civilian national security force"", Taitz told me she ""realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her ""greatest supporter"", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% ""weren't
sure"". ""Obama should be in the Big House"", Taitz shrieked to me, ""not the White House!""

When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the ""Other"", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the ""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. ""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama"",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, ""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world"", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party ""Patriots"" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
""real America"". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying ""ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters."" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of ""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.

Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of ""economic freedom"". She claimed the Democratic ""cap-
and-trade"" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for ""socialism"" (though she admitted her family ""used to hustle over the border"" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for ""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death panels"" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as ""the lie of 2009"". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. ""President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there"", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: ""Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual."" He thundered, ""The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!""
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.
The enemy

The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: ""One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas."" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""terror-management theory"" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer ""grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns."" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's ""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"", a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day"", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, ""Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"" from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: ""I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us."" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: ""Death
lives!""
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party ""Patriots"". During a broadcast of ""Fox and Friends"", Beck opined that Obama
""has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture."" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's ""socialist"" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
""Obama money"" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to
Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that ""Obama's SS"" was being
trained across inner-city America.

In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. ""Trust me"", Beck said,
""Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so."" (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: ""Whitewater is about healthcare."")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. ""Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know"", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. ""He's opened our eyes to so much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. ""We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was"", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as ""required reading"" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that ""coercive taxation"" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of ""amours"" with ""old women,"" and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that
""powerful influences congregating in the United States"" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.

Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,
""conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.""
From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-
communism for obvious financial purposes.""
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the
radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared
entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea
Party ""suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""
The descent
Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots
celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his
mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply"", Mack warned, ""you control the
people. And that's the first step to slavery.""
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.
Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established
figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals, secret policemen, rats."" With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by
cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since
1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform
was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance
plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in
healthcare negotiations. ""He's a big hero now in the pro-life community"", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. ""Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power.""
To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to
Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015
virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""
On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the
civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot"", eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel
Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.
With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and take these fascists down"", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of
an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""
The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House
floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In
response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. ""The motion to commit does
not support life"", Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" Heckling from the Republican side
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, ""Baby
killer!"" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a
right-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows"",
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them and
run to break again."" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and
Arizona had been shattered.
Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative
Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged
activists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper
attacks.
After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence
thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded the
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.

Dear Burns:
It has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your
assistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.
My hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:
1. After the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American
corporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication
infrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an
implementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other ""first responders""
had stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is
much closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding
effort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the
earthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would
have little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an ""advisory council on Haitian infrastructure"" (which
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773048 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773048 Date: 08/31/2015
then could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on
President Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of
names of infrastructure CEOs, etc.
2. On a much more personal note, two friends of Isabella and mine, were in the final B6
stages of adopting two infants out of a Haitian orphanage when the earthquake struck. Since that time, the process has
obviously stopped and they have had no word on the fate of these two babies, their welfare or the prospects for getting
them out of their earthquake-ravaged environment into their new home and family in the United States. I have attached
a significant amount of detail about the babies, the orphanage, etc.
Burns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,
but knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these t •e of individual
situations. Is it possible for you to find that person so that I can make the request and so our friend can
provide him/her with any additional information that they might need?
I really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or
day on my cell phone
Come visit us in Princeton.
Best regards,
David Crane

Hi -- you guys are doing great work.
Wanted to let you know that we've sent a dozen members -- nurses, paramedics and trauma specialists to Haiti. They
are working with Paul Farmer's Partners in Health. This is the first deployment of 74 members who have volunteered in
Vermont. The work and being helpful is so important to them and to us. A number of people on our staff worked
throughout the weekend to make all the necessary arrangements, but the impetus came directly from our members.
As you know the challenges are enormous, but we have a long-term commitment to the reconstruction of the health
and education sectors in Haiti. Please let us know how we can be helpful.
Hope you're well.

- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when
many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together,
Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and
is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways:
""Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an
unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel
can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern
information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that
help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And
technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by
governments to crush dissent and deny human rights.""
And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:
""On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United
States does.""
- Underscoring the ""this is a big deal"" tone of the speech, she enumerated the ""Four Freedoms
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms> ""that FDR proclaimed in 1941, as part of the struggle for the world's
future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for
details.
- The China surprise: the speech was a More frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an
itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:
""In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan
have stepped up their censorship of the internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly
disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained.""
Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent
sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking Japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations... all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-
deal SecState addresses by accident.
Other passages to the same effect:
""As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the
records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....
""Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our
government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and
international condemnation....""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773054 Date: 08/31/2015
And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main
argument for leaving it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find
a ""win-win-win <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/behind_on_google-china-ology.php> ""
acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, it's not necessarily a help to have the
U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant: as a proxy
for China's own ability to fulfill its potential
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/about_the_stakes_for_china_in.php> and sustain its economic
rise:
""To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of
censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers
don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over
the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is
no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied
access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth.
""Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration
in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend.
The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities
to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for
that investigation and its results to be transparent.
""The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many
people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet
users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different
views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive,
cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.""
There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.
Back to the to-do list for me now.

Family Planning in the Obama Administration Budget
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773066 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773066 Date: 08/31/2015
WASHINGTON, DC —The women of the world have true friends in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
Obama administration. After years of inadequate funding during the previous administration, yesterday's Fiscal Year
2011 budget request for an increase in international family planning is a critical step forward in demonstrating our
nation's renewed commitment to ensuring that women worldwide have access to safe and effective reproductive health
care.
The Obama administration has sent a strong signal that the status quo is unacceptable. Every year more than half a
million women — nearly all of whom live in developing countries — die of pregnancy-related causes. Moreover, one in
three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had
access to it.
To strengthen our working relationships with partners around the world, as well as our image, the United States must
increase access to family planning. By ensuring that women have increased access to the family planning they need, our
nation is working to make good on its commitment to promote the health of all women and their families.
An investment in family planning is an investment that reaps significant dividends. By providing education, counseling
and contraceptives to women and couples, we are working to strengthen families worldwide. We also will help achieve
major reductions in infant and maternal mortality, HIV infections and global poverty. As Secretary Clinton has said,
""There's a direct connection between a woman's ability to plan her family, space her pregnancies, and give birth safely,
and her ability to get an education, work outside the home, support her family, and participate fully in the life of her
community.""
Planned Parenthood works with partners across the globe to eliminate barriers to basic reproductive health care that is
essential to the health and well-being of women, men and children everywhere. Limited access to health care, lack of
political will, legal and regulatory restrictions, cultural taboos, and harsh gender inequality all put women at risk of
unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The
commitment of Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration to international family planning will further the efforts
of Planned Parenthood and others to help women overcome barriers to accessing needed reproductive health care.
As the Fiscal Year 2011 budget and appropriations process moves forward, we look forward to working with Congress to
build on this request so that we may adequately address the global health challenges facing women worldwide.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has been told by doctors he had to rest because he had a slipped disc,
the state-news agency SPA reported on November 12. SPA quoted a royal court statement as saying doctors had
ordered the king, who is in his 80s, to rest under a treatment plan.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Release of Aung San Suu Kyl
Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long-overdue release of Burmese democracy leader
and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human
rights to Burma, including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years. The Burmese regime has repeatedly
rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all,
Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered.
The United States calls on Burma's leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi's release is unconditional so that she may
travel, associate with her fellow citizens, express her views, and participate in political activities without restriction. They
should also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burma's 2,100 political prisoners.
We urge Burma's leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi
and other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, and
democratic future.

Quite an interesting reply to my fanmail to the blogger I've been copying to you.
Hello Coco,Thank you for your kind words and sorry for the late reply -- I've been busy with the holiday season (also why
there's been a drop-off in posts Iately),I wouldn't place an extra emphasis on Haji's arrest (or on anyone at Baran, for
that matter). I think those arrests were geared at intimidating Khatami more than anything. Although he's been more
quiet than either Mousavi or Karoubi, he has ""international clout,"" if you will, so I believe the regime is less willing to
attack him head-on. (Though what we witnessed on Tasooa was admittedly shocking). Actually, with a few exceptions, I
think a threshold has been passed where arrests aren't even strategic anymore. It seems that the vast majority are for
the sake of intimidation. The regime is looking increasingly desperate.Rafsanjani, I'm sure, is up to something. He's a
good ally, but I think the pro-democracy movement should always be wary of his intentions. Ultimately, Rafsanjani is
looking out for Rafsanjani. Having said that, I think his interests and those of the Greens have and will continue to
coalesce. Before the election, this was him funding Mousavi's campaign (in hopes that Mousavi's presidency would bring
him back into the fold after the rise of the ""new right""). Now (and going forward), he's probably more concerned about
his legacy in Iran. We should remember he was the driving force that ascended Khamenei to the Supreme Leadership,
and that there were also accusations that the 2005 election (where he lost to Ahmadinejad) was fixed. Not to simplify
things, but I'm sure there is some resentment. Regardless, sooner or later he's going to have to be more bold and give
the opposition something (namely momentum, as he did with his July sermon) if he wants to get something back (clout,
legacy, etc.).Things are continuing to heat up! God-willing, change will come in 2010. Whether such a change is
ultimately 'regime change' should be up to the Iranian people inside Iran.Best Sent using BlackBerry® from

I've always wanted to go to Qom, and Iran too admittedly, as you know, more for the far history than recent I confess. I
can't sort out whether I want to go more or less now though because of recent turmoil/promise/discontent; maybe
want and sense are merely opposing forces! If only I could find an approproate Jane Austen quote...

suppresses any figures about the support these clerics have, but we're talking millions.
The Society's power to disqualify Sanei is pretty questionable and it's a provocative act - all you need in Shiism to
become a Marja-e Taghlid is the faith of followers and confirmation of ""two fair and knowledgeable individuals"" and this
move is the latest in a decade long move by Khamenei to shift the clergy's power and authority away from their
constituency of followers and towards the government (increasing the clergy's dependence on the state for funds has
been the primary tool of reform.) Since Ashura the silence from Qom has been notable and this disqualification will split
the clergy further into those who side with the government and those who bet on popular support for their long term
influence. This last group are increasingly being forced to show their hand and incur punishment/risk assassination of
themselves or family members (cf Mousavi's nephew.)
Predictably, harder line clerics like Ayatollah Hussein Nouri Hamedani and former Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi have sided with Khamenei and the Rev Guard, as has Larijani (a key move by a smart betting man), but the
majority remain on the fence - and the next few weeks that include the mourning rituals for Ayatollah Montazeri, the
Ashura Martyrs, Arbein (40 days after Ashura) and the Anniversary of the Revolution on 2nd February will be events to
watch. Each of them are mass public rituals that have underpinned the Islamic Revolution for 30 years, and canceling
them would indicate extraordinary weakness by the government. They are obvious opportunities for the Green
Movement to mobilize, risk death and continue the cycle; the government knows it doesn't have the training or self
control to contain them peacefully and must be scratching their heads over how to stop this cycle. Forcing Revolutionary
Guard officers to shoot civilians is also a very risky move.
The ultimate fence sitter, and key figure behind Mousavi and Karroubi is of course Rafsanjani - who came out in veiled
support of the government, and it's supporters on Saturday, 2nd Jan. This support either cost Khamenei something, or
the Revolutionary Guard and he found leverage with the Shark. All a bit murky. Rafsanjani's clearly hedging his bets and
may feel that he would do best out of a negotiated National Unity Plan.

(NB 's pretty emotional - and clearly skewed, but useful info). http://www.thenewestdeal.org/2009/10/national-
unity-plan.html
http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=115190&sectionid=351020101
I still think the Western Press is optimistic about Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard's weakness - but moves like
that against Montazeri and Sanei, and inflation running unofficially at 25% (confirmed by furious down town Tehran
friends quoting tomato prices) may finally push a broader tranche of society to join what has been a middle class protest
until now. The big problem with the 'protest' is that it doesn't have a credible leader, or stated ideals, but it's certainly
terrified those in power.
Predictions are for nutters in this situation, but I would doubt that Khamenei has the stomach for civil war, and there
must be some deals cooking. It's a tricky one for the West over who to support - because no deal will be clean.
To be continued...

Hi Cheryl:
Today, I was able to have good preliminary conversations with Jean Bonilla and Lorraine Hariton in EEB. Both Jean and
Lorraine are very excited about the opportunity to partner on this new area for the Secretary and provided me with
some very valuable insight and discussion on how we can partner and collaborate on programming and initiatives
together.

I also included the information from ECA — that we discussed in the document. The INR meeting was cancelled today and
will be scheduled for early next week. As I move around the Department and talk with other officials in the coming
week, I believe we will be able to build out a more robust Work Plan and garner some great collaborations on this
effort.
Additionally, in a recent conversation that I had with Governor O'Malley from Maryland, I shared with him that the
Secretary was launching a new effort that would assist state and local leaders with respect to their global affairs
portfolios. The Governor was extremely excited and remarked that he has some great idea for the Secretary about how
the Department can be a major value-add to local governments. He told me that he wants to be very engaged in what
we do in the Department in this area. I will be scheduling a time to meet with him and his economic team once my
position has been announced. He wanted me to let her know that he had been thinking about her and wanted to reach
out and did not know how and then I walked in and we began to have this discussion and he said — what a way to start
his year for 2010 — something coming to reality that he had been thinking about.
Also, Maura Pally in ECA forwarded me a meeting that I took with the Deputy Director of the National Lieutenant
Governor's Association. They were in town working on their upcoming Washington meeting. They too are very excited
about what we are planning and want to work very closely with us in the coming months as we launch this effort. Lt.
Governor Bill Bolling in VA is the current Chair.
Please let me know if you need to make any additional changes. Thanks so much for all of your assistance and
support!!!
Have a great New Years!!
Best,

Rough translation of the points below:
Evo Morales announced today that his government will ask for an emergency meeting at the UN to ""reject the U.S.
military occupation"" in Haiti, according to Spanish news agency EFE.
""It is not possible that the U.S. is using a natural disaster to invade and occupy Haiti,"" said Morales, who qualified
as ""inhumane, savage, and opportunist"" the deployment of troops in the Caribbean island.
""We'll ask the UN, via our Foreign Ministry, for an emergency meeting to reject this military occupation of the U.S.
in Haiti,"" announced Morales.
Morales recalled that President Obama has guaranteed in international fora that he wants partners and respectful
diplomatic relations with other countries. ""You don't achieve this (partners, diplomatic relations) with military
occupation, or troops, or bases,"" he said and expects ""a pronouncement by the peoples of the world and social forces
rejecting this intervention and military occupation in Haiti.""
Morales also asked ""how much money, food and water"" will be destined to the 12,000 soldiers the U.S. sent to
Haiti and noted that this money ""should be spend on the victims.""

on qualifying as ""military intervention.""

EVO MORALES PIDE REUNION DE EMERGENCIA PARA REPUDIAR Y RECHAZAR A EEUU EN HAITI, INFORMA EFE
Evo Morales anunciO hoy que su Gobierno pedira a Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para ""repudiar y
rechazar la ocupacion militar de Estados Unidos"" en Haiti, informa la agencia espariola EFE.
""No es posible que Estados Unidos use una desgracia natural para invadir y ocupar militarmente Haiti"", dijo
Morales, quien califico de ""inhumano, salvaje y oportunista"" el despliegue de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses en la
isla caribefia.
""Vamos a pedir mediante la cancilleria a las Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para repudiar y rechazar
esta ocupaciOn militar de Estados Unidos hacia Haiti"", anuncio Morales.
Morales recordo que el mandatario de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, ha garantizado en foros internacionales que
desea tener socios y relaciones diplomaticas de respeto mutuo con el resto de 'Daises. ""Ser socios o tener relaciones
diplomaticas no se hace con ocupacion militar, ni con tropas militares, ni con bases militares"", dijo y espera ""un
pronunciamiento de todos los pueblos del mundo y de las fuerzas sociales rechazando esta intervention y ocupaciOn
militar en Haiti"".
Morales se preguntO tambien ""cuanta plata, cuantos alimentos o cuanta agua"" se van a destinar para abastecer a
los 12.000 soldados que Estados Unidos ha mandado a Haiti y considero que ese dinero ""deberia gastarse en los
damnificados"" por el terremoto y no en los militares.
• Confio en que el propio pueblo estadounidense rechace ""el use abusivo"" de sus recursos econornicos para lo que
insistio en calificar como ""intervenciOn militar"".

DEAUVILLE (Reuters) - Russia wants to take part in a NATO-backed missile defense shield and will go to next month's
NATO summit, softening its stance after reassurances from France and Germany, a source close to participants said on
October 19.
Security is a major stumbling block in Russia's relationship with the West and has dominated talks between Presidents
Sarkozy and Medvedev and Chancellor Merkel in the northern French seaside town of Deauville.
The source said that Medvedev himself would attend the NATO summit, which is due to unveil a new strategic plan
for the 28-country alliance on November 19-20 in Lisbon.

Subject: (AP) Indian report: Pakistan spies tied to Mumbai siege
NEW DELHI (AP) - A U.S. citizen convicted of scouting locations for the 2008 Mumbai attack said Pakistan's spy agency
was deeply involved in the planning of the assault.
David Headley told Indian interrogators that officers from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave him
$25,000 to fund his scouting missions to Mumbai ahead of the attack.
He said he debriefed his ISI handler every time he returned to Pakistan from Mumbai. He said his handler also made
suggestions about how best to carry out the attack.
The revelations were contained in the Indian government's report on its June interrogation of Headley. The report,
marked secret, was obtained by The Associated Press.
The Mumbai attacks killed 166 people.

TEHRAN (AP) - Venezuelan President Chavez has arrived in Tehran for talks with Iranian leaders expected to focus on
efforts to boost cooperation between the allies oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
Iranian state television says Chavez was greeted by Industry Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian at Tehran's Mehrabad
airport upon arrival early October 19.
State TV says Chavez will hold talks with President Ahmadinejad, during his two-day visit.
The Venezuelan leader backed Iran in its confrontation with the West over Tehran's disputed nuclear program. The
U.S. accuses Iran of seeking to develop an atomic bomb. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

Hillary Clinton Calls on TechWomen and Green Girls for Global Change
Friday night, I waited at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, surrounded by Bomb Squad vehicles and black bulletproof SUVS, for
Hillary Clinton to speak to an audience of 1,400, only her third appearance in the United States since she took office as Secretary of
State in early 2009. Upon entering the room, she grinned widely and received a standing ovation, welcomed with open arms by the
loyal crowd. After a brief introduction, she cut straight to the point. The government needs innovation to solve our problems and the
world's problems. And she meant it.
I live tweeted much of the event, including a lengthy Q&A that brought up issues all over the world, starting with Afghanistan, leading to
our neighbors, Canada and Mexico. E.B. Boyd ofFastCompany described the call for tech innovators quite well in her article, and the
full transcript of the event was published on the State.gov website. So while I could regurgitate many quotes from the two hour
Commonwealth Club event again here, I won't. Instead, I'll focus on the fine points affecting women, girls and bloggers -- our
community here at BlogHer.

The world is broken in so many ways. We're reminded of it every day with photos of flooded villages, exploding cities, and starving
children. Rather than taking the ""glass half empty"" approach and leaving it for other people to deal with, Secretary Clinton holds onto
optimism. Slowly, over generations, she believes we can solve these problems through collaboration across governments and cultures,
paired with innovative thinking and an entrepreneurial spirit. Included in this, not just as an afterthought, comes the role of women and
girls.
It's no secret Clinton is an advocate for women's rights, but she has also become a champion of global education for all, based not only
on her personal conviction but on numerous data sources showing how educating girls can change entire communities. The State
Department understands that this is a complex undertaking. But these communities also need protection. In order to help them, Clinton
explains, we must equip their governments and their people with the knowhow and a multitude of resources and tools to continue
developing on their own. Afghanistan is only one example of this, and the mWomen global initiative puts cell phones directly in the
hands of women who need them for basic communications and commerce.
Meanwhile, in more developed regions, we can provide mentorship opportunities. That's where State's new TechWomen initiative
comes in. Implemented by the Institute of International Education and the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, TechWomen
will bring 38 women from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the West Bank and Gaza for five weeks of mentorship by leaders
in Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Twitter, HP Labs, Facebook, Symantec along with Bay Area based Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.
TechWomen provides just one way of opening up dialogues between women on how to innovate to solve global problems. It's part of
her view on ""21st Century Statecraft."" The State Department has also, over the past 20 months, taken extraordinary leaps in terms of
new media, for those who haven't noticed. Just look at their website now vs. two years ago (courtesy Archive.org), view their Twitter
feed, or observe their Facebook page. They're not just giving the Gov 2.0 movement lip service; they're full partners.
Which brings me back to girls. The final question from the Q&A on Friday night was from a young girl. She asked, ""I am 10 years old
and I'm worried about my future environment. What can people do to help?"" Clinton's soft spot couldn't have been more obvious. She
beamed at the young girl and told her ""there is a lot that you can do.""
Clinton continued to explain that in her experience, ""young people are much more environmentally conscious and committed to
protecting the world you're growing up in than some of us older people are."" (Earlier in the Q&A, she emphasized her extreme
displeasure at the lack of strong environmental legislation coming out of the Senate.) She then provided a disclaimer that she can't
comment on politics as Secretary of State, but noted, ""speaking as a private citizen, I think people running for office should be asked to
explain their positions on what they're going to do."" In other words, improve transparency about what candidates plan to do for the
environment and other important issues when they're elected, and hold them accountable.
After another standing ovation, Clinton stepped off the ballroom stage and departed the hotel, along with the Secret Service, Bomb
Squad trucks and darkened motorcade. But she left behind a room full of proactive thinkers, dreamers and doers, the majority of whom
were women, who will take her words to heart and make them happen. I implore the BlogHer community to join in this worthy endeavor.
Sarah Granger blogs here and there. She is curating BlogHer's political content through Election 2010.

Dearest Cheryl -
You are so good at what you do. I was reminded of it this morning when I heard you on NPR. You're the perfect person
to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going on. I know you don't
enjoy doing press, but you are very good at it and I think it is important for the American public to understand the
mission of the U.S. government and the high respect and deference you are giving to the Haitian government. You really
got that across this morning.
Sending you lots of love and good luck in your incredibly important mission.
xo,
Ann

<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/hillary_clintons_internet_free.php> I Main
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/>
A momentous 40 hours, leading to Clinton/China/Internet
21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm
Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator from
Massachusetts, and the new Buckley v. Valeo <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo> (by which I mean
today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruling
<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703699204575016942930090152.html> that removes limits from
direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that will have big ripple effects. I
mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about ""Internet Freedom,"" mentioned here
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/hillary_clintons_internet_free.php> and with a prelude
discussion here <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/interesting_chinagoogle_discus.php> .
I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, here
<http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm> , or watching the official video, here
<http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1705667530?bctid=62730021001> . And for now some of the main
points while listening (and noting main points down in real time with the handy LiveScribe

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773152 Date: 08/31/2015
- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when
many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together,
Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and
is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways:
""Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an
unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel
can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern
information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that
help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And
technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by
governments to crush dissent and deny human rights.""
And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:
""On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United
States does.""
- Underscoring the ""this is a big deal"" tone of the speech, she enumerated the ""Four Freedoms
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms> "" that FDR proclaimed in 1941, as part of the struggle for the world's
future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for
details.
- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese Internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an
itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:
""In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan
have stepped up their censorship of the internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly
disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained.""
Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent
sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking Japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations... all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-
deal SecState addresses by accident.
Other passages to the same effect:
""As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the
records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....
""Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our
government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and
international condemnation....""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773152 Date: 08/31/2015
And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main
argument for leaving it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find
a ""win-win-win <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/behind_on_google-china-ology.php> ""
acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, it's not necessarily a help to have the
U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant: as a proxy
for China's own ability to fulfill its potential
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/about_the_stakes_for_china_in.php> and sustain its economic
rise:
""To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of
censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers
don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over
the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is
no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied
access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth.
""Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration
in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend.
The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities
to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for
that investigation and its results to be transparent.
""The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many
people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet
users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different
views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive,
cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.""
There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.
Back to the to-do list for me now.

Cheryl:
After watching scenes on TV, talking w/ you and others, here is idea for nearly immediate way to get kids back 'in school'
or into school for the first time. It would be very cheap, could get started very soon—say mid-February, could be linked
to other distribution networks (food/medical supplies), and would be quite organic and grassroots. I'll call it the Griot
education project (in the west African tradition of a streetside storytellers).
Context/Understanding:
Looks like there are a few hundred thousand kids in Port-au-Prince who pretty soon will be (already are) sitting around
day-to-day wi more or less nothing to do. Their schools got destroyed, their neighborhoods in rough shape. These are
young kids who would be best served if they could get out of the house for a few hours a day (possibly even freeing up
parents to do rebuilding or other work), and not spend their time getting caught up in crime, or desperately searching
through rubble for a mal to eat...and get back to school, and engage their naturally curious brains.
The goal of this program is to immediately give them a place to go, a chance to interface with an energetic educator, and
at least expose them to relevant, skill-enhancing academic work that engages them while we rebuild education
infrastructure. It also would likely get them 1 meal each day, and if needed a way to get referred for immediate medical
attention.

morning—educators who after a few days will find a place to teach, and will have attracted class of students. This is
modeled off the street artist/storyteller.
We flyer the neighborhoods, advertising teaching positions. We work w/ whoever we can find who can help us identify
people who were good teachers prior to the earthquake and/or people who have the abilty to attract kids
(appropriately).
We select teachers. We agree to pay them a daily/weekly stipend. We want people who know their communities, who
don't need a lot of direction, who will take a cart full of educational materials, find a corner, or abandoned building and
start teaching to whoever shows up. People who will do anything to get some young kids to try to read or do some math
problems or sing songs and write poetry...
Education Supply Centers
We set up education supply centers and a distribution system. Each center is staffed by small team-1 lead person is an
education-leader, others are admin and support. Griots come the center in the morning, they get a day's worth of
educational materials (we select it, we photocopy it, we give them 50 pencils, etc.). We agree to send over 50 meals
two hours later. Each Griot wheels his portable classroom to his/her spot and sets up shop...Kids come, and he/she
teaches. It builds momentum and kids get off the streets, out of their homes and come to the morning 'school' site.
Kids who come get a meal. Maybe we end up w/ 3 tiers of Griots-1 who works w/ 4, 5, 6 year olds, 1 with 7, 8, 9 year
olds, 1 with 10, 11, 12 year olds. Each one picks up a packet of material that is more or less appropriate for that age
group. All this is incredibly flexible and fluid. Maybe one morning session and then an after lunch session.
The education supply centers are warehouses we set up. They have copiers, lots of paper, basic school supplies, some
art supplies, etc. (Over time, maybe people donate a bunch of books or magazines, etc—they become ways for artists,
volunteers, entertainers to connect w/ kids, as well.) Each morning a group of Griots go to their supply centers and pick
up materials, and fill up their cart...and roll down the block, or blocks and set up their 'school' for the day. Maybe
someone wants to donate a bunch of art supplies, or harmonicas—who knows—whatever it takes to get kids to show
up and do some academic and enrichment activities. These education supply centers likely get linked to other
distribution hubs. This way they can get linked w/ food or other supplies.
Longer-term/setting the stage for longer-term ramp up
Over time, some of the Griots will end up running little schools that start to feel permanent. Kids will bring in chairs and
stools...maybe some of the teaching material ends up staying at the school sites, and the end up as likely places for folks
to build/rebuild schools. But in the near term, the 'school' is whatever spot the Griot goes to where he/she can attract a
cadre of kids—and the good news is that can be almost anywhere.

This program is cheap -- as costly as it is to pay stipends to the Griots, plus the cost of supplies, delivery, and some
human capital to man the supply centers, develop/acquire high interest, high educational value material. I think quite
cheap, and could easily be costed out once we knew about how much we need to pay a Griot for a day of teaching.
It also gets some folks working, immediately.
Some Griots would take stipend and not teach; some wouldn't do it well; some would pawn off the food/biscuits...But
we could weed much of that out and w/ this sort of approach, you don't let a few bad apples spoil the larger program
(or fear of them stop it from getting started). This program is about planting the seeds for the future schools to come,
about getting young kids off streets and stoops and into a fun/learning environment, about empowering talented
teacher-artists to go out into their communities armed w/ some basic materials, their good will, their creativity (and a
paycheck)—together the kids and the Griots will find local places to call and claim as their schools.
And while this is going on, we have time to build out infrastructure (human capital, facilities, instructional/curricular
materials) for more robust ramp-up over time.
Per usual, feel free to ignore or pass on.

Dear Burns:
It has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your
assistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.
My hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:
1. After the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American
corporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication
infrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an
implementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other ""first responders""
had stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is
much closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding

effort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the
earthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would
have little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an ""advisory council on Haitian infrastructure"" (which
then could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on
President Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of
names of infrastructure CEOs, etc.
2. On a much more personal note,
Burns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,
but knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these type of individual
situations.
I really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or
day on my cell phone
Come visit us in Princeton.
Best regards,
David Crane

JERUSALEM (AP) - Diplomatic sources said the United States offered Israel an incentive package to reinstate
a moratorium on West Bank settlement building in an effort to revive stalled peace talks with the
Palestinians. Under the deal, Israel would stop settlement construction for 90 days in the West Bank, but not in
east Jerusalem. Among the incentives, the United States would fight resolutions critical of Israel at the United
Nations.

Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
""We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
time,"" said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.
""UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that
existed already beforehand.
""Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.""
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
wake of the quake.

However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
local authorities and relief coordination ""to kidnap children and get them out of the country"".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
trafficking in Haiti was ""an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
months"".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
""We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,"" he said.
""This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable.""
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in
hospitals.

If you have the time or inclination, it would be really nice if you could send an email to Tomicah, or phone him. He went

Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
""We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
time,"" said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.
""UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that
existed already beforehand.
""Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.""
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
wake of the quake.

However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
local authorities and relief coordination ""to kidnap children and get them out of the country"".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
trafficking in Haiti was ""an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
months"".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
""We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,"" he said.
""This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable.""
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in
hospitals.

me to the letter that has or will find its way to you from the university president. I forward it to you in case you haven't
seen it, want to get out in front of it, or whatever. The fact that you were instinctively sensitive to this situation should
always be enough but, of course, with this type of loss, it never is. I hope all else is well, there has to be some good news

Dear Brian,
I wanted to thank you again for
I read with interest today's article in the NY Times on how well the Obama Administration-State Dept is managing the
crisis and associated PR. I know this would be a wonderful opportunity to serve two causes and get some great PR as
well as put the minds of many families at ease if the Sate Department were to make a statement of support for ""leaving
no stone unturned until all Americans lost in Haiti can be returned to their families"". I have already reached out to
Senator Reid as well who had a liaison of his following up on search efforts. You will notice below the University is
making a plea to Secretary Clinton directly, she may or may not be, aware. Again, thank you for your time and if this can
be put in the proper hands it would so be appreciated. You have already done more than I would have expected; and, I
did not want anyone to be surprised if they had not heard of the University and the families making the plea to
Secretary Clinton.

hi kev...please take note and see if anything else can be done...
President Kevin M. Ross remarks from 5 p.m. press briefing
As we all know, the world suffered one of the greatest natural disasters in history last Tuesday. The 7.0
earthquake that was centered just outside Port-au-Prince imperiled the lives of all those in Haiti, including 14 members
of our Lynn University family who were there on a mission trip. All 14 were on site at the Hotel Montana when the
quake struck, and we have reason to believe that our four missing students and two faculty may be there still.
In the nine days since that tragedy, we have all been captivated by the stories of heroism, triumph, anguish and
loss that have followed in the wake of this earthquake. And every day, we rejoice for what good news has been
broadcast out of the country: the elderly woman rescued from beneath a crumbled cathedral; the child pulled alive and
almost completely well from a wrecked home. As the family members of our missing students and employees have said
in recent days, we have taken comfort in these reports, and celebrated them almost as if they were our own good news.
And for good reason. It is our good news. This tragedy is not a Lynn University tragedy alone. It does not affect
just us, our community members, and their families. It affects us all. It affects people from around the world. It affects
those that survived, and those that did not. And it impacts most severely those in Haiti itself—the people who call that
country home.
Our ""Journey of Hope"" students went to Haiti to deliver hope. Eight have returned. And six remain missing. We
still have hope— hope that a miracle is in the making. Hope that our six are found safe and sound. And hope that many

others too will be freed and reunited with loved ones around the world. That remains our most ardent wish here at Lynn
University.
But there is another hope we have. A different kind of hope. And it is that hope that I wish to express tonight.
We have hope that whatever the days ahead may bring, that we have the United States government's assurance that
every person lost in this tragedy will be returned to their loved ones.
I want this personally. I want this for the families of our missing students and faculty, and our more than three
dozen employees and eight students with family missing in the country. And I want it for the campus community I
serve— a community that will need to grieve as well.
This is needed for every grieving father, son, mother, daughter, friend and neighbor who is aching at this very
moment for a phone call. Whenever that phone call comes, I join the families of our missing six in demanding that such a
call contain news of the whereabouts of the missing. A missing family member, whether alive or dead, must be returned
to his or her loved ones.
Forces are mounting in defense against such a call. From the outset of this crisis my office has been served in
immeasurable ways by Senator George S. LeMieux and Congressman Ron Klein and their staffs in Florida and D.C. The
two have helped however they could to aid us in our search efforts. And tonight they are standing with us to ask
Secretary Clinton and others to ensure that all Americans missing and unaccounted for in Haiti be returned home.
This is the assurance our campus community — and the families of these missing loved ones — will require in the
days ahead. And many other American families will appreciate the same.. Tonight I have a letter already signed by
Senator LeMieux urging the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the U.S. Agency for International
Development to continue ""search and rescue efforts until the possibility of survival no longer exists"" and to do
""everything within (their) power to ensure that every American known to be missing in Haiti is located and returned
home.""
I am so thankful for the senator's support, and the support of Congressman Klein, who has also pledged to back
us in this push. We hope all of our elected officials will join us — including those in Massachusetts, Georgia, New Jersey
and New York, the home states of our four missing students. So many have already shown their support and concern.
But now, we need assurances. We need a commitment to returning the missing to their families. Only this will give the
families of the victims the peace they need to carry on.
We have been saying from the beginning how thankful we are for the prayers and support we have received
here at Lynn University. The outpouring of support has been incredible. Please continue to offer those prayers and cross
those fingers. We still believe in miracles. And we wish those same miracles upon all of you who are still uncertain at this
hour.
Thank you all. And God bless.

Statement from Cecile Richards on International
Family Planning in the Obama Administration Budget
WASHINGTON, DC —The women of the world have true friends in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
Obama administration. After years of inadequate funding during the previous administration, yesterday's Fiscal Year
2011 budget request for an increase in international family planning is a critical step forward in demonstrating our
nation's renewed commitment to ensuring that women worldwide have access to safe and effective reproductive health
care.
The Obama administration has sent a strong signal that the status quo is unacceptable. Every year more than half a
million women — nearly all of whom live in developing countries — die of pregnancy-related causes. Moreover, one in
three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had
access to it.
To strengthen our working relationships with partners around the world, as well as our image, the United States must
increase access to family planning. By ensuring that women have increased access to the family planning they need, our
nation is working to make good on its commitment to promote the health of all women and their families.
An investment in family planning is an investment that reaps significant dividends. By providing education, counseling
and contraceptives to women and couples, we are working to strengthen families worldwide. We also will help achieve
major reductions in infant and maternal mortality, HIV infections and global poverty. As Secretary Clinton has said,
""There's a direct connection between a woman's ability to plan her family, space her pregnancies, and give birth safely,
and her ability to get an education, work outside the home, support her family, and participate fully in the life of her
cornmunity.""
Planned Parenthood works with partners across the globe to eliminate barriers to basic reproductive health care that is
essential to the health and well-being of women, men and children everywhere. Limited access to health care, lack of
political will, legal and regulatory restrictions, cultural taboos, and harsh gender inequality all put women at risk of
unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773199 Date: 08/31/2015
commitment of Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration to international family planning will further the efforts
of Planned Parenthood and others to help women overcome barriers to accessing needed reproductive health care.
As the Fiscal Year 2011 budget and appropriations process moves forward, we look forward to working with Congress to
build on this request so that we may adequately address the global health challenges facing women worldwide.
###
Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and
advocate. We believe that everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child, and that every child
should be wanted and loved. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate more than 840 health centers nationwide, providing
medical services and sexuality education for millions of women, men, and teenagers each year. We also work with allies
worldwide to ensure that all women and men have the right and the means to meet their sexual and reproductive
health care needs.

Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical collective dissection
we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative; arcane, funny, brilliant, baked,
etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging <http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/22/wait-can-foreign-companies-
now-spend-on-us-political-elections/> is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of the
new ""corporation as full citizen-person"" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Newsweek
<http://biog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-spend-money-on-u-s-
political-candidates.aspx> and the Center for Public Integrity <http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/1913/> .
""Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I
guess this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system."" So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo
Chavez want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born Cities Services
Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens

United ruling could conceivably allowVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past
two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV
ads bashing his target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining Company and half of
Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's
Chinese Academy of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the
limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that
operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the Supreme Court as the opinions were
being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the ""cautious view of corporate power"" held by
the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured
exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and
steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

Congo's Enough Moment:
The Case for Conflict Minerals Certification and Army Reform
As a growing consumer movement demands cell phones and gadgets that are guaranteed
not to fuel atrocities in eastern Congo, there is an opportunity to end the exploitation of
Congo's people and the pillaging of its resources.
In a new report, ""Congo's Enough Moment: The Case for Conflict Minerals
Certification and Army Reform,""Enough Project Co-founder John Prendergast argues
that growing international attention to Congo and widespread interest in conflict minerals
has shined a spotlight on eastern Congo, opening a significant window for policy reform.
""The new U.S. law on conflict minerals and the growing global campaign have shaken up
the supply chain, and all those that are profiting say they are willing to change,"" says
Prendergast. ""It is time for the U.S. government and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to
help leverage the end of the war in eastern Congo through leadership on two of the issues
that will catalyze a broader solution to the cycles of violence there: minerals certification
and comprehensive army reform.""

DUP has gone behind closed doors at Stormont and the smart money is on them emerging at some point supporting the
deal.
There was movement today on the ancillary issue of government support for the Presbyterian Mutual Society, a savings
and loan that lost a lot of money and whose investors didn't get the same financial crisis protections as those in other
institutions. DUP members are pointing to that as enough of a carrot to change their posture on the policing and justice
deal.
Brown and Cowen are poised to go to NI tomorrow. Will keep you posted.

This is from Justice Stevens' dissent in the Citizens United case:
!f taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government's ability
to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the
propaganda broadcasts to our troops by ""Tokyo Rose"" during World War Il the same protection as speech by Allied
commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled
by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could "" 'enhance the relative voice' "" of some ( i.e. ,
humans) over others ( i.e. nonhumans). Ante , at 33 (quoting Buckley , 424 U. S., at 49). 51

Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love
about the web. It's the kind of typical collective dissection we have now come
to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane,
funny, brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging
<http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/22/wait-can-foreign-companies-now-spend-on-us-political-elections/>
is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of
the new ""corporation as full citizen-person"" framework, drawing on blogging

going on at Newsweek <http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-

and the Center for Public integrity <http://www.publicintegrity.org/articlesientry/1913/>
""Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely
in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate
globalization of the U.S. electoral system."" So you gotta ask yourself: Who does
Hugo Chavez want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<httplicoloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of
foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the
American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan
government-owned PetrOleos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could
conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized
both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an
American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his
target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi
Refining Company and half of Motiva Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC
assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy
of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations.
A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia,

Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S.
could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the
Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the ""cautious
view of corporate power"" held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle
softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a
chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an
anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon
and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

Slogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love

Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of
foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the
American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan
government-owned Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could
conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized
both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an
American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his
target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi
Refining Company and half of Motiva Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC
assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy
of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations.
A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S.
could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April
Henry McDonald <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald>

guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.ukh , Friday 5 February 2010 11.42 GMT
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/accessibility>
Gordon Brown, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness <http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773249 Date: 08/31/2015
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring becauie of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the'rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.

""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.

Dear Ms Mills,
My name is Steven Everts and I am responsible in the Private Office of HR/VP Ashton for EU-US relations (I was the one
handlig the very successful meeting in Washington that the Secretary had with the HR/VP on 21 Jan).
I now have a more personal issue: apparently the Secretary and the HR/VP spoke briefly in London
The HR asked me whether there is a more personal, direct email she could use for transmitting this type of messages?
From our side, the email to use would be
I would be very grateful if you could send us an email which is similarly private.
Many thanks for your help.
Kind regards
Steven Everts

Reid: Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees
Friday, Feb. 5, 2010
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort to
win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, according
to aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid.
Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a vote
on any nomination by filing cloture.
Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous
consent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.
The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture.
While holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is
normal.
""He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue,"" a Democratic aide said. ""They're qualified and
they should be moving forward.""
Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican
holds on executive nominees.
""We've got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection to
them -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business,"" President Obama
said Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.
On the Senate floor Thursday, Reid, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senate
Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.

Reid, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush from
making recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the
president can make when the Senate is out of session.
""What alternatives do we have?"" Reid said on the floor Thursday. ""What alternative do we have?""
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on ""several pending nominees due to
unaddressed national security concerns,"" including frustrations with the Air Force's handling of the competition for an
aerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.
Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-
stakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but has
threatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.
""Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have a
transparent and fair acquisition process to move forward,"" the spokesman said. ""The Department of Defense must
recognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.""
Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals
soon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.
""Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but
we will move forward,"" Gates said. ""We have to have new tankers.""
In addition to the tanker issue, Shelby's spokesman said he is frustrated that the Oba ma administration won't build an
Alabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.
Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical
Center to be set up at the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
""Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic
and technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort,"" the
spokesman said. ""He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.""
Also Thursday, Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was considering
whether Senate rules should be changed.
""There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a
supermajority on almost everything,"" Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who gives
Republicans 41 votes, enough to filibuster on any issue.
""What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this, you know, the use of the
filibuster and how it's worked,"" Biden said. ""This is not a constitutional requirement.""
Biden defended the 60-vote requirement, calling it ""a useful tool. It's legitimate, but from my perspective having served
here, having been elected seven times, I've never seen a time when it's become sort of standard operating procedure....
Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business.""

Thank you so much for your support for this project and for how quickly you made it move. Please convey our thanks to
the Secretary for her leadership on this issue. It has truly touched our members. As you may have seen, it received wide
attention within LGBT media, youth media (MTV and VH1), and the wider media. The video has over 110,000 views on
youtube already, and she is likely to touch many more people as it spreads.
Many thanks,

You may remember that I called on you early in the Administration on the UN statement on sexual
orientation. You were tremendous as was the Secretary. This request is not in keeping with the regular
hierarchy, but I had to send it. The video the Secretary did is extraordinarily powerful. Can you let her know
that individual employees in the building appreciate what she has been doing on LGBT rights? I know GLIFFA
will do so, but it's kind of their job to advocate. But if you could just tell her in a minute how deeply her work
is touching us in the trenches, well, it's something I think she deserves to hear.

encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which, led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow. So the
plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting the
agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond,
theoretically forcing him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your role and support of the
US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and Empey). Shaun would like to speak with you soon depending
on how things are working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday (perhaps after Commons). Dinner

Moments of imperial and economic decline
-- according to a recent poll, 65% of
Americans now believe this country to be
""in a state of decline"" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness
incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be
spreading through the United States. It's
not so surprising, really: Since the attacks
of September 11, 2001, fear has
been iniiecttcl into this ""homeland"" like a
drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has
settled over the land in a way that makes
the secrecy of the Cold War years (when
this country faced a superpower, not a
ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and
terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and
hysteria amid declining living conditions,
""explanations"" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of
conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a
patina of plausibility and so traction. No
wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the
financial system seemed on the verge of
collapse, as unemployment soared and a
massive wave of home foreclosures swept
into view, increasing numbers of
Americans became prey to any wacky
explanation for our troubles, none more so
than the idea that Islam was somehow
responsible, that mosques and Islamic
centers meant for a sliver of a minority here
were capable of imposing anything, no less
a way of life on this country, or that Sharia
law (of all things) might somehow worm
its way into state teal systems, or that
YouTube was a hotbed of.terrorism worthy
of suppression, or... well, you name it.
Max Blumenthal, author of the bestselling
book Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside the
Movement Thai Shattered the Party, has
done the necessary legwork to""take us deep
into one of those crews of conspiracy-
mongers who, at another time, just about
no one would have paid much attention to,
but in twenty-first-century America have
gained a remarkable audience. They are a
chilling barometer of the changing weather

By Max Blumenthal
Nine years after 9/11,
hysteria about Muslims in
American life has gripped
the country. With it has
Gone an outburst of arson
attacks on mosques,
campaigns to stop their
construction, and the
branding of the Muslim-
American community,
overwhelmingly moderate,
as a hotbed of potential
terrorist recruits. The frenzy
has raged from rural
Tennessee to New York
City, while in Oklahoma,
voters even overwhelmingly
Approved a ballot measure
banning the implementation
of Sharia law in American
courts (not that such a
prospect existed). This
campaign of islamophobia
wounded President Oba.ma
politically, as one out of five
Americans have bought
into a sustained chorus of
false rumors about his secret
Muslim faith. And it may
have tainted views of
Muslims in general; an
August 2010 Pew Research
Center poll revealed that,
among Americans, the
favorability rating of
Muslims had dropped by 11
points since 2005.
Erupting so many years after
the September 11th trauma,
this spasm of anti-Muslim
bigotry might seem oddly
timed and unexpectedly
spontaneous. But think
again: it's the fruit of an
organized, long-term
campaign by a tight
confederation of right-Wing
activists and operatives who
first focused on
Isia.mophobia soon after the
September 11th attacks, but
only attained critical mass
during the Obama era. It
was then that embittered
conservative forces, voted
out of power in 2008, sought
with remarkable success to
leverage cultural resentment
into political and partisan
gain.
This network is obsessively
fixated on the supposed
spread of Muslim influence
in America. Its apparatus
spans continents, extending
from Tea Party activists here
to the European far right. It
brings together in common
cause right-wing ultra-
Zionists, Christian
evangelicals, and racist
British soccer hooligans. It
reflects an aggressively pro-
Israel sensibility, with its
key figures venerating the
Jewish state as a Middle
Eastern Fort Apache on the
front lines of the Global
War on Terror and urging
the U.S. and various
European powers to emulate
its heavy-handed methods.
Little of recent American
Jslamophobia (with a.strong
emphasis on the ""phobia"") is
sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock
troops massed for angry
protests outside the
proposed site of an Islamic
community center in lower
Manhattan, representatives
of the Israel lobby and the
Jewish-American
establishment launched a
campaign against pro-
Palestinian campus activism
that would prove a seedbed
for everything to come. That
campaign quickly -- and
perhaps predictably --
morphed into a series of
crusades against mosques
and islarilic schools which,
in turn, attracted an
assortment of shady but
exceptionally energetic
militants into the network's
ranks.
Besides providing the initial
energy for the islamophobic
crusade, conservative
elements from within the
pro-Israel lobby bankrolled
the network's apparatus,
enabling it to influence the
national debate. One
philanthropist in particular
has provided the
beneficence to propel the
campaign ahead. He is a
little-known Los Angeles-
area software security
entrepreneur named Aubrey
Chernick, who operates out
of a security consulting firm
blandly named the National
Center for Crisis and
Continuity Coordination. A
former trustee of the
Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, which has
served as a think tank for the
American Israeli Public
Affairs Committee
(AIPAC), a frontline
lobbying group for Israel,
Chernick is said to be worth
$750 million.
Chemick's fortune is puny
compared to that of the
billionaire Koch Brothers,
extraction industry titans
who fund Tea Party-related
groups like Americans for
Prosperity, and it is dwarfed
by the financial empire of
Haim Saban, the Israeli-
American media baron who
is one of the largest.-orivate
donors to the Democratic
party and recently matched
$9 million raised for the
Friends of the Israeli
Defense Forces in a single
night. However, by injecting
his money into a small but
influential constellation of
groups and individuals with
a narrow agenda. Chernick
has had a considerable
impact.
Through the Fairtmook
Foundation, a private entity
he and his wife Joyce
control, Chernick has
provided funding to groups
ranging from the Anti-
Defamation League (ADL)
and CAMERA, a right-
wing, pro-Israel, media-
watchdog outfit, to violent
Israeli settlers living on
Palestinian lands and figures
like the pseudo-academic
author Robert Spencer, who
is largely responsible for
popularizing conspiracy
theories about the coming
conquest of the West by
Muslim fanatics seeking to
establish a worldwide
caliphate. Together, these
groups spread hysteria about
Muslims into Middle
American communities
where immigrants from the
Middle East have recently
settled, and they watched
with glee as likely
Republican presidential
frontrunners from Mike
Huckabee to Sarah Palin
pmmoted their cause and
oarpe.ki their tropes.
Perhaps the only thing more
surprising than the
increasingly widespread
appeal of islamophobia is
that, just a few years ago,
the phenomenon was
confined to a few college
campuses and an inner city
neighborhood, and that it
seemed like a fleeting fad
that would soon pass from
the American political
landscape.
Birth of a Network
The fslamophobic crusade
was launched in earnest at
the peak of George W.
Bush's prestige when the
neoconservatives and their
allies were riding high. In
2003, three years after the
collapse of President Bill
Clinton's attempt to resolve
the Israeli-Palestinian issue
and in the immediate wake
of the invasion of Iraq, a
network of Jewish groups,
ranging from ADL and the.
American Jewish
Committee to AIPAC,
gathered to address what
they saw as a sudden rise in
pro-Palestinian activism on
college campuses
nationwide. That meeting
gave birth to the David
Project, a campus advocacy
group led by Charles Peters,
who had co-founded
CAMERA, one of the many
outfits bankrolled by
Chernick. With the help of
public relations
professionals,. Peters
ci a plan to ""take
back the campus by
influencing public opinion
through lectures. the
Internet, and coalitions,"" as
a memo produced at the
time by the consulting firm
McKinsey and Company
stated.
In 2004, after conferring
with Martin Kramer, a
fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East
Policy, the pro-Israel think
tank Where Chernoff had
served as a trustee, Peters
produced a documentary
film that he called Columbia
""rbecornint., It was -filled
with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia
University claiming they
had endured intimidation
and insults from Arab
professors. The film
portrayed that New York
City school's Department of
Middle East and Asian
Languages and Cultures as a
hothouse of anti-Semitism.
In their complaints, the
students focused on one
figure in particular: Joseph
.vlassa.d, a Palestinian
professor of Middle East
studies. He was known for
his passionate advocacy of
the formation of a binational
state between Israel and
Palestine, as well as for his
strident criticism of what he
termed ""the racist character
of Israel."" The film
identified him as ""one of the
most dangerous intellectuals
on campus,"" while he was
featured as a crucial villain
in The Professors: The 101
Most Dangerous Academics
in America, a book by the
(Chemick-•funded)
neoconservative activist
David Horowitz. As
Massad was seeking tenure
at the time, he was
especially vulnerable to this
sort of wholesale assault.
When the controversy over
Massad's views intensified,
Congressman Anthony
Weiner, a liberal New York
Democrat who pqee
:lescri himself as a
representative of ""the ZOA
[Zionist Organization of
America] wing of the
Democratic Party,""
demanded that Columbia
President Lee Bollinger,
a
renowned First Amendment
scholar, fire the professor.
Bollinger responded by
issuing uncharacteristically
defensive statements about
the ""limited"" nature of
academic freedom.
In the end, however, none of
the charges stuck. Indeed,
the testimonies in the David
Project film were eventually
either discredited or never
corroborated. In 2009,
Massad earned tenure after
winning Columbia's
prestigious Lionel Trilling
Award for excellence in
scholarship.
Having demonstrated its
ability to intimidate faculty
members and even powerful
university administrators,
however, Kramer claimed a
moral victory in the name of
his project, boasting to the
press that ""this is a turning
point."" While the David
Project subsequently
fostered chapters on
campuses nationwide, its
director set out on a
different path -- initially,
into the streets of Boston in
2004 to oppose the
construction of the Islamic
Society of Boston Cultural
Center.
For nearly 15 years, the
Islamic Society of Boston
had sought to build the
center in the heart of
Roxbury, the city's largest
black neighborhood, to
serve its sizable Muslim
population. With
endorsements from Mayor
Thomas Menino and leading
Massachusetts lawmakers,
the mosque's construction
seemed like a fait accompli -
- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston
Herald and his local Fox
News affiliate snapped into
action. Boston Globe
columnist Jeff Jacoby also
chimed in with a series of
reports claiming the center's
plans were evidence of a
Saudi Arabian plot to bolster
the influence of radical
Islam in the United States,
and possibly even to train
underground terror cells.
It was at this point that the
David Project entered the
fray, convening elements of
the local pro-Israel
community in the Boston
area to seek strategies to
torpedo the project.
According to emqiis
obtained by the Islamic
Society's lawyers in a
lawsuit against the David
Project, the organizers
settled on a campaign of
years of nuisance lawsuits,
along with accusations that
the center had received
foreign finding from ""the
Wahhabi movement in
Saudi Arabia or... the
Moslem Brotherhood.""
In response, a grassroots
coalition of liberal Jews
initiat4d inter-faith efforts
aimed at ending a
controversy that had
essentially been
manufactured out of thin air
and was corroding relations
between the Jewish and
Muslim communities in the
city. Peters would not,
however, relent. 'We are
more concerned now than
we have ever been about a
Saudi influence of local
mosques,"" he ,apounced at
a suburban Boston
synagogue in 2007.
After paying out millions of
dollars in legal bills and
enduring countless smears,
the Islamic Society of
Boston completed the
construction of its
community center in 2008.
Meanwhile, not surprisingly,
nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As
Boston-area National Public
Radio reporter Philip Martin
reflected in September 2010,
""The horror stories that
preceded [the center's]
development seem shrill and
histrionic in retrospect.""
The Network Expands
This second failed campaign
was, in the end, more about
movement building than
success, no less national
security. The local crusade
established an effective
blueprint for generating
hysteria against the
establishment of Islamic
centers and mosques across
the country, while
galvanizing a cast of
characters who would form
an anti-Muslim network
which would gain attention
and success in the years to
come.
In 2007, these figures
coalesced into a proto-
movement that launched a
new crusade, this time
targeting. the Khalil Gibran
International Academy, a
secular Arabic-English
elementary school in
Brooklyn, New York.
Calling their ad hoc pressure
group, Stop the Madrassah
madrassah being simply
the Arab word for ""school"" -
- the coalition's activists
included an array of
previously unknown zealots
who made no attempt to
disguise their extreme views
when it came to Islam as a
religion, as well as Muslims
in America. Their stated
goal was to challenge the
school's establishment on
the basis of its violation of
the church-state separation
in the U.S.
Constitution. The true aim
of the coalition, however,
was transparent: to pressure
the city's leadership to adopt
an antagonistic posture
towards the local Muslim
community.
The activists zeroed in on
the school's principal,
Debbie Almontaser, a
veteran educator of Yemeni
descent, and baselessly
.branded her ""a jihadist"" as
well as a 9/11 denier. They
also accused her of-- as
Pamela Geller, a far-right
blogger just then gaining
prominence put it,
""whitewash[ing] the
genocide against the
Jews."" Daniel Pipes, a
neoconservative academic
previously active in the
campaigns against Joseph
Massad and the Boston
Islamic center (and whose
pro-Likud think tank,
Middle East .Forum, has
received $150,000 from
Chernick) Jamed the
school should not go ahead
because ""Arabic-language
instruction is inevitably
laden with Pan-Arabist and
Islamist baggage."" As the
campaign reached a fever
pitch, Almontaser reported
that members of the
coalition were actually
stallsinQ her wherever she
went.
Given what Columbia
Journalism School professor
and former New York Times
reporter Samuel Freedman
called ""her clear, public
record of interfaith activism
and outreach,"" including
work with the New York
Police Department and the
Anti-Defamation League
after the September 11th
attacks, the assault on
.Almontaser seemed little
short of bizarre -- until her
assailants discovered a
photograph of a T-shirt
produced by AWAAM, a
local Arab feminist
organization, that read
""Intifada NYC."" As it
turned out, AWAAM
sometimes shared office
space with a Yemeni-
American association on
which Almontaser served as
a board member. Though
the connection seemed like a
stretch, it promoted the line
of attack the Stop the
Madrassah coalition had
been seeking.
Having found a way to
wedge the emotional issue
of the Israel-Palestine
conflict into a. previously
New York-centered
campaign, the school's
opponents next gained a
platform at the Murdoch-
owned New York Post,
where reporters Chuck
Bennett and Jana Winter
claimed her T-shirt was
""apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the
Big Apple."" While
Almontaser attempted to
explain to the Post's
reporters that she rejected
terrorism„ the Anti-
Defamation League chimed.
in on cue. ADL spokesman
Oren Segal told the Post:
""The T-shirt is a reflection
of a movement that
increasingly lauds violence
against Israelis instead of
rejecting it. That is
disturbing.""
Before any Qassam rockets
could be launched from
Almontaser's school, her
former ally New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
caved to the growing
pressure and threatened to
shut down the school,
prompting her to resign. A
Jewish principal who spoke
no Arabic replaced
Almontaser, who later filed
a lawsuit against the city for
breaching her free speech
rights. In 2010, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission ui that New
York's Department of
Education had ""succumbed
to the very bias that the
creation of the school was
intended to dispel"" by firing
Almontaser and urged it pay
her $300,000 in damages.
The commission also
concluded that the Post had
quoted her misleadingly.
Though it failed to stop the
establishment of the Khalil
Gibran Academy,•the
burg:eoning anti-M sliin
movement succeeded in
forcing city leaders to bend
to its will, and having
learned just how to do that,
then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets.
As the ,New York Times
s!..t_..at the time, ""The
fight against the school...
was only an early skirmish
in a broader, national
struggle.""
s a battle that has really
just begun."" Pipes told the
Times.
From Scam to Publicity
Coup
Pipes couldn't have been
more on the mark. In late
2009, the Isiamophobes
sprang into action again
when the Cordoba Initiative,
a non-profit Muslim group
headed by Feisai Abdul
Rauf, an exceedingly
moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly
lepic,,etiting the
United States at the behest
of the State Department,
announced that it was going
to build a community center
in downtown New ""NCork
City. With the help of
investors, Raufs Cordoba
Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground
Zero in Manhattan. The
space was to contain a
prayer area as part of a large
community center that
would be open to everyone
in the neighborhood.
None of these facts mattered
to Pamela Geller. Thanks to
constant prodding at her
Nog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller
made Cordoba's
construction plans a national
issue, provokino fervent
calls faml conservatives to
protect the ""hallowed
ground"" of 9/11 from
creeping Sharia. (That the
""mosque"" would have been
out of sight of Ground Zero
and that the neighborhood
was, in fact.
everything from strip clubs
to fast-food joints didn't
matter.) Geller's activism
against Cordoba House
earned the 52-year-old full-
time blogger the attention
she apparently craved.,
including a • 1 in
the Neu, York ThIleS and
frequent cable news spots,
esoeciallv, of course, on Fox
News.
Mainstream reporters tended
to focus on Geller's bizarre
stunts. She posted a video
of herself
in a string bikini on a Fort
Lauderdale beach, for
instance, while ranting about
""left-tards"" and ""Nazi
Hezbollah."" Her gall for
boycotting Campbell's Soup
because the company
offered halal -- approved
under Islamic law (as kosher
food is under Jewish law) --
versions of its products got
her much attention, as did
her .cron-lotior of a screed
claiming that President
Barack Obama was the
illegitimate lovechild of
Malcolm X.
Geller had never earned a
living as a journalist. She
supported herself with
millions of dollars in a
divorce settlement and life
insurance money from her
ex-husband. He died in
2008, a year after being
for an alleged $1.3
million scam he was
accused of-running out of a
car dealership he co-owned
with Geller. Independently
wealthy and with time on
her hands, Geller proved
able indeed when it came to
exploiting her strange media
stardom to in.cite the already
organized political network
of islamophobes to intensify
their crusade.
She also benefited from
close alliances with leading
islamophobes from Europe.
Among Ocher's allies was
Andrew Gravers, a Danish
activist who formed the
group Stop the
Islamicization of Europe,
and :.1a.-ye it the unusually
blunt motto: ""Racism is the
lowest form of human
stupidity, but Islamophobia
is the height of common
sense."" Gravers' group
inspired Geller's own U.S.-
based outfit, Stop the
Islamicization of America,
which she formed with her
friend Robert Spencer, a
pseudo-scholar whose
bestselling books, including
The Truth About
Muhammad, Founder of the
World's Most Intolerant
Religion, prompted former
advisor to President Richard
Nixon and Muslim activist
Robert Crane to ca/1
""the principal leader... in
the new academic .field of
Muslim bashing.""
(According to the website
almost $1 million
in donations from Chernick
has been steered to
Spencer's Jihad Watch
group through David
Horowitz's Freedom
Center.)
Perfect sources for
Republican political figures
in search of the next hot-
button cause, their rhetoric
found its way into the
talking points of Newt
Gingrich and Sarah Patin as
they propelled the crusade
against Cordoba House into
the national spotlight.
Gingrich soon pared the
community center to a Nazi
sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while
Patin called it ""a stab in the
heart"" of ""the Heartland.""
Meanwhile, Tea Party
candidates like Republican
Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war
veteran who killed two
unarmed Iraqi civilians,
shooting them 60 times -- he
even stopped to reload
made their opppsition to
Cordoba House the
centerpiece of midterm
congressional campaigns
conducted hundreds of miles
from Ground Zero.
Geller's campaign against
""the mosque at Ground
Zero"" gained an unexpected
assist and a veneer of
legitimacy from established
Jewish leaders like Anti-
Defamation League
National Director Abraham
Foxman. ""Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to
feelings that are irrational,""
he et.:narked to the New
York Times. Comparing the
bereaved family members of
9-1 1 victims to Holocaust
survivors, Foxman insisted,
""Their anguish entitles them
to positions that others
would categorize as
irrational or bigoted.""
Soon enough, David Harris,
director of the (Chernick-
funded) American Jewish
Committee, was demanding
that Cordoba's leaders be
compelled to reveal their
""true attitudes"" about
Palestinian militant groups
before construction on the
center was initiated. Rabbi
Marvin Hier of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los
Angeles, another major
Jewish group, insisted it
would be ""insensitive"" for
Cordoba to build near ""a
cemetery,"" though his
organization had recently
been granted permission
from the municipality of
Jerusalem to build a
""museum of tolerance"" to be
called The Center for
Human Dignity directly on
top of the Mamilla
Cemetery, a Muslim
Graveyard that contained
thousands of grave sites
dating back 1,200 years.
Inspiration from Israel
It was evident from the
involvement of figures like
Gravers that the
Islamophobic network in the
United States represented a
trans-Atlantic expansion of
simmering resentment in
Europe. There, the far-right
was storming to victories in
parliamentary elections
across the continent in part
by appealing to the
simmering anti-Muslim
sentiments of voters in rural
and working-class
communities. The extent of
the collaboration between
European and American
Islamophobes has only
continued to grow with
Geller, Spencer, and even
Gingrich standing beside
Europe's most prominent
anti-Muslim figure, Dutch
pad iamentarian Geed
Wilders, at a rally against
Cordoba House. In the
meantime. Geller was
issuing statements of
sunport for the Emdish
Defense League, a band of
uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis
and former members of the
whites-only British National
Party who intimidate
Muslims in the streets of
cities like Birmingham and
London.
In addition, the trans-
Atlantic Islamophobic
crusade has stretched into
Israel, a country that has
come to symbolize the
network's fight against the
Muslim menace. As Geller
told the New York Times'
Alan Feuer, Israel is ""a very
good guide because, like I
said, in the war between the
civilized man and the
savage, you side with the
civilized man.""
EDL members regularly
wave Israeli flags at their
rallies, while Wilders claims
to have formed his views
about Muslims during the
time he worked on an Israeli
cooperative farm in the
1980s. He has, he says,
visited the country more
than 40 times since to meet
with rightist political allies
like Aryeh Eldad, a member
of the Israeli Knesset and
leader of the far right
Hatikvah faction of the
National Union Party. He
has called for forcibly
""transferring"" the
Palestinians living in Israel
and the occupied West Bank
to Jordan and Egypt. On
December 5th, for example,
Wilders traveled to Israel for
a 'ffrjend nieei,imr, with
Foreign Minister Avi2clor
Lieberman, then declared at
a press conference that
Israel should annex the West
Bank and set up a
Palestinian state in Jordan.
In the apocalyptic clash of
civilizations the global anti-
Muslim network has sought
to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar,
located on the hills above
the occupied Palestinian city
of Nablus, represent front-
line fortresses. Inside
Yitzar's state-funded
yeshiva, a rabbi named
Yitzhak Shapira has
instructed students in what
rules must be applied when
considering killing non-
Jews. Shapira summarized
his opinions in a widely
publicized book. Torat
HaMelech, or The King's
Torah. Claiming that non-
Jews are ""uncompassionate
by nature,"" Shapira cited
rabbinical texts to declare
that gentiles could be killed
in order to ""curb their evil
inclinations."" ""There is
justification,"" the rabbi
proclaimed, ""for killing
babies if it is clear that they
will grow up to harm us, and,
in such a situation they' may
be harmed deliberately, and
not only during combat with
adults.""
In 2006, the rabbi was
briefly held by Israeli police
for urging his supporters to
murder all Palestinians over
the age of 13. Two years
later, according to the Israeli
newspaper Ilaaretz, he
a rabbinical letter in
support of Israeli Jews who
had brutally assaulted two
Arab youths on the country's
Holocaust Remembrance
Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a
suspect in helping
a rocket attack
against a Palestinian village
near Nablus.
Though he was not charged,
his name came up again in
connection with another act
of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police
raided his settlement
seeking vandals who had set
fire to a nearby mosque.
One of Shapira's followers,
an American immigrant,
Jack _Mite"", has confessed to
murdering two innocent
Palestinians and attempting
to the kill the liberal Israeli
historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.
What does all this have to
do with Islamophobic
campaigns in the United
States? A great deal,
actually. Through New
York-based tax-exempt non-
profits like the Central Fund
of Israel and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the
omnipresent Aubrey
Chernick has sent tens of
thousands of dollars to
support the Yitzar
settlement, as well as to the
messianic settlers dedicated
to ""Judaizing"" East
Jerusalem. The settlement
movement's leading online
news magazine. Arutz
Sheva, has feattired Geller
as a columnist. A friend of
Geller's, Beth Gili.nsky, a
right-wing activist with a
group called the Coalition to
Honor Ground Zero and the
founder of the Jewish
Action Alliance (apparently
ttun. out of a Manhattan real
estate office), organized a
large rally in New York City
in April 2010 to protest the
Obama administration's call
for a settlement freeze.
Among Chemick's major
funding recipients is a
supposedly ""apolitical""
group called Aish. Hatorah
that claims to educate Jews
about their heritage. Based
in New York and active in
the fever swamps of
northern West Bank
settlements near Yitzar,
Aish Hatorah shares an
address and staff with a
shadowy foreign non-profit
called the Clarion Fund.
During the 2008 U.S.
election campaign, the
Clarion Fund distributed 28
million DVDs of a
propaganda film called
Obsession as newspaper
inserts to residents of swing
states around the country.
The film featured a who's
who of anti-Muslim
activists, including \Valid
Shoebat, a self-proclaimed
""former PLO terrorist.""
Among Shoebat's more
striking statements: ""A
secular dogma like Nazism
is less dangerous than is
Islamofascism today."" At a
Christian gathering in 2007,
this ""former Islamic
terrorist"" told the crowd that
Islam was a ""satanic cult""
and that he had been born
again as an evangelical
Christian. In 2008, however,
the Jerusalem Post, a right-
leaning newspaper, exposed
h rn as a fraud, whose
claims to terrorism were
fictional.
Islamophobic groups
registered only a minimal
impact during the 2008
election campaign. Two
years later, however, after
the Republicans regained
control of the House of
Representatives in midterm
elections, the network
appears to have reached.
critical mass. Of course, the
deciding factor in the
election was the economy,
and in two years, Americans
will likely vote their
pocketbooks again. But that
the construction of a single
Islamic community center or
the imaginary threat of
Sharia law were issues at all
reflected the influence of a
small band of locally
oriented activists, and
suggested that when a
certain presidential
candidate who has already
been demonized as a crypto-
Muslim runs for reelection,
the country's most vocal
Islamophobes could once
again find a national
platform amid the frenzied
atmosphere of the campaign.
By now, the Islamophobic
crusade has gone beyond the
right-wing pro-Israel
activists, cyber-bigots, and
ambitious hucksters who
conceived it. It now belongs
to leading Republican
presidential candidates, top-
rated cable news hosts, and
crowds of Tea Party
activists. As the fervor
spreads, the crusaders are
basking in the glory of what
they accomplished. ""I didn't
choose this moment,"" Geller
mused to the New York
Times, ""this moment chose
me.""

Moments of imperial and economic decline
-- according to a recent poll, 65% of
Americans now believe this country to be
""in a state of decline"" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness
incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be
spreading through the United States. It's
not so surprising, really: Since the attacks
of September 11, 2001, fear has
been iniiecttcl into this ""homeland"" like a
drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has
settled over the land in a way that makes
the secrecy of the Cold War years (when
this country faced a superpower, not a
ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and
terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and
hysteria amid declining living conditions,
""explanations"" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of
conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a
patina of plausibility and so traction. No
wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the
financial system seemed on the verge of
collapse, as unemployment soared and a
massive wave of home foreclosures swept
into view, increasing numbers of
Americans became prey to any wacky

wounded President Oba.ma
politically, as one out of five
Americans have bought

false rumors about his secret
Muslim faith. And it may
have tainted views of
Muslims in general; an

among Americans, the
favorability rating of
Muslims had dropped by 11
points since 2005.
Erupting so many years after
the September 11th trauma,
this spasm of anti-Muslim
bigotry might seem oddly
timed and unexpectedly
spontaneous. But think
again: it's the fruit of an
organized, long-term
campaign by a tight
confederation of right-Wing
activists and operatives who
first focused on
Isia.mophobia soon after the
September 11th attacks, but
only attained critical mass
during the Obama era. It
was then that embittered
conservative forces, voted
out of power in 2008, sought
with remarkable success to
leverage cultural resentment
into political and partisan
gain.
This network is obsessively
fixated on the supposed
spread of Muslim influence
in America. Its apparatus

from Tea Party activists here
to the European far right. It
brings together in common
cause right-wing ultra-
Zionists, Christian
evangelicals, and racist
British soccer hooligans. It
reflects an aggressively pro-
Israel sensibility, with its
key figures venerating the
Jewish state as a Middle
Eastern Fort Apache on the
front lines of the Global
War on Terror and urging
the U.S. and various
European powers to emulate
its heavy-handed methods.
Little of recent American
Jslamophobia (with a.strong
emphasis on the ""phobia"") is
sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock
troops massed for angry
protests outside the
proposed site of an Islamic
community center in lower
Manhattan, representatives
of the Israel lobby and the
Jewish-American
establishment launched a
campaign against pro-
Palestinian campus activism
that would prove a seedbed
for everything to come. That
campaign quickly -- and
perhaps predictably --
morphed into a series of
crusades against mosques
and islarilic schools which,
in turn, attracted an
assortment of shady but
exceptionally energetic
militants into the network's
ranks.
Besides providing the initial
energy for the islamophobic
crusade, conservative
elements from within the
pro-Israel lobby bankrolled
the network's apparatus,
enabling it to influence the

the Israeli-Palestinian issue
and in the immediate wake
of the invasion of Iraq, a
network of Jewish groups,
ranging from ADL and the.
American Jewish

gathered to address what
they saw as a sudden rise in
pro-Palestinian activism on
college campuses
nationwide. That meeting

Internet, and coalitions,"" as
a memo produced at the
time by the consulting firm
McKinsey and Company
stated.
In 2004, after conferring
with Martin Kramer, a
fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East
Policy, the pro-Israel think
tank Where Chernoff had
served as a trustee, Peters
produced a documentary
film that he called Columbia
""rbecornint., It was -filled
with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia
University claiming they
had endured intimidation
and insults from Arab
professors. The film
portrayed that New York
City school's Department of
Middle East and Asian
Languages and Cultures as a
hothouse of anti-Semitism.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
In their complaints, the
students focused on one
figure in particular: Joseph
.vlassa.d, a Palestinian
professor of Middle East
studies. He was known for
his passionate advocacy of
the formation of a binational
state between Israel and
Palestine, as well as for his
strident criticism of what he
termed ""the racist character
of Israel."" The film
identified him as ""one of the
most dangerous intellectuals
on campus,"" while he was
featured as a crucial villain
in The Professors: The 101
Most Dangerous Academics
in America, a book by the
(Chemick-•funded)
neoconservative activist
David Horowitz. As
Massad was seeking tenure
at the time, he was
especially vulnerable to this
sort of wholesale assault.
When the controversy over
Massad's views intensified,
Congressman Anthony
Weiner, a liberal New York
Democrat who pqee
:lescri himself as a
representative of ""the ZOA
[Zionist Organization of
America] wing of the
Democratic Party,""
demanded that Columbia
President Lee Bollinger,
a
renowned First Amendment
scholar, fire the professor.
Bollinger responded by
issuing uncharacteristically
defensive statements about
the ""limited"" nature of
academic freedom.
In the end, however, none of
the charges stuck. Indeed,
the testimonies in the David
Project film were eventually
either discredited or never

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
corroborated. In 2009,
Massad earned tenure after
winning Columbia's
prestigious Lionel Trilling
Award for excellence in
scholarship.
Having demonstrated its
ability to intimidate faculty
members and even powerful
university administrators,
however, Kramer claimed a
moral victory in the name of
his project, boasting to the
press that ""this is a turning
point."" While the David
Project subsequently
fostered chapters on
campuses nationwide, its
director set out on a
different path -- initially,
into the streets of Boston in
2004 to oppose the
construction of the Islamic
Society of Boston Cultural
Center.
For nearly 15 years, the
Islamic Society of Boston
had sought to build the
center in the heart of
Roxbury, the city's largest
black neighborhood, to
serve its sizable Muslim
population. With
endorsements from Mayor
Thomas Menino and leading
Massachusetts lawmakers,
the mosque's construction
seemed like a fait accompli -
- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston
Herald and his local Fox
News affiliate snapped into
action. Boston Globe
columnist Jeff Jacoby also
chimed in with a series of
reports claiming the center's
plans were evidence of a
Saudi Arabian plot to bolster
the influence of radical
Islam in the United States,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
and possibly even to train
underground terror cells.
It was at this point that the
David Project entered the
fray, convening elements of
the local pro-Israel
community in the Boston
area to seek strategies to
torpedo the project.
According to emqiis
obtained by the Islamic
Society's lawyers in a
lawsuit against the David
Project, the organizers
settled on a campaign of
years of nuisance lawsuits,
along with accusations that
the center had received
foreign finding from ""the
Wahhabi movement in
Saudi Arabia or... the
Moslem Brotherhood.""
In response, a grassroots
coalition of liberal Jews
initiat4d inter-faith efforts
aimed at ending a
controversy that had
essentially been
manufactured out of thin air
and was corroding relations
between the Jewish and
Muslim communities in the
city. Peters would not,
however, relent. 'We are
more concerned now than
we have ever been about a
Saudi influence of local
mosques,"" he ,apounced at
a suburban Boston
synagogue in 2007.
After paying out millions of
dollars in legal bills and
enduring countless smears,
the Islamic Society of
Boston completed the
construction of its
community center in 2008.
Meanwhile, not surprisingly,
nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As
Boston-area National Public

Radio reporter Philip Martin
reflected in September 2010,
""The horror stories that
preceded [the center's]
development seem shrill and
histrionic in retrospect.""
The Network Expands
This second failed campaign
was, in the end, more about
movement building than
success, no less national
security. The local crusade
established an effective
blueprint for generating
hysteria against the
establishment of Islamic
centers and mosques across
the country, while
galvanizing a cast of
characters who would form
an anti-Muslim network
which would gain attention
and success in the years to
come.
In 2007, these figures
coalesced into a proto-
movement that launched a
new crusade, this time
targeting. the Khalil Gibran
International Academy, a
secular Arabic-English
elementary school in
Brooklyn, New York.
Calling their ad hoc pressure
group, Stop the Madrassah
madrassah being simply
the Arab word for ""school"" -
- the coalition's activists
included an array of
previously unknown zealots
who made no attempt to
disguise their extreme views
when it came to Islam as a
religion, as well as Muslims
in America. Their stated
goal was to challenge the
school's establishment on
the basis of its violation of
the church-state separation
in the U.S.
Constitution. The true aim

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
of the coalition, however,
was transparent: to pressure
the city's leadership to adopt
an antagonistic posture
towards the local Muslim
community.
The activists zeroed in on
the school's principal,
Debbie Almontaser, a
veteran educator of Yemeni
descent, and baselessly
.branded her ""a jihadist"" as
well as a 9/11 denier. They
also accused her of-- as
Pamela Geller, a far-right
blogger just then gaining
prominence put it,
""whitewash[ing] the
genocide against the
Jews."" Daniel Pipes, a
neoconservative academic
previously active in the
campaigns against Joseph
Massad and the Boston
Islamic center (and whose
pro-Likud think tank,
Middle East .Forum, has
received $150,000 from
Chernick) Jamed the
school should not go ahead
because ""Arabic-language
instruction is inevitably
laden with Pan-Arabist and
Islamist baggage."" As the
campaign reached a fever
pitch, Almontaser reported
that members of the
coalition were actually
stallsinQ her wherever she
went.
Given what Columbia
Journalism School professor
and former New York Times
reporter Samuel Freedman
called ""her clear, public
record of interfaith activism
and outreach,"" including
work with the New York
Police Department and the
Anti-Defamation League
after the September 11th
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
attacks, the assault on
.Almontaser seemed little
short of bizarre -- until her
assailants discovered a
photograph of a T-shirt
produced by AWAAM, a
local Arab feminist
organization, that read
""Intifada NYC."" As it
turned out, AWAAM
sometimes shared office
space with a Yemeni-
American association on
which Almontaser served as
a board member. Though
the connection seemed like a
stretch, it promoted the line
of attack the Stop the
Madrassah coalition had
been seeking.
Having found a way to
wedge the emotional issue
of the Israel-Palestine
conflict into a. previously
New York-centered
campaign, the school's
opponents next gained a
platform at the Murdoch-
owned New York Post,
where reporters Chuck
Bennett and Jana Winter
claimed her T-shirt was
""apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the
Big Apple."" While
Almontaser attempted to
explain to the Post's
reporters that she rejected
terrorism„ the Anti-
Defamation League chimed.
in on cue. ADL spokesman
Oren Segal told the Post:
""The T-shirt is a reflection
of a movement that
increasingly lauds violence
against Israelis instead of
rejecting it. That is
disturbing.""
Before any Qassam rockets
could be launched from
Almontaser's school, her

former ally New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
caved to the growing
pressure and threatened to
shut down the school,
prompting her to resign. A
Jewish principal who spoke
no Arabic replaced
Almontaser, who later filed
a lawsuit against the city for
breaching her free speech
rights. In 2010, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission ui that New
York's Department of
Education had ""succumbed
to the very bias that the
creation of the school was
intended to dispel"" by firing
Almontaser and urged it pay
her $300,000 in damages.
The commission also
concluded that the Post had
quoted her misleadingly.
Though it failed to stop the
establishment of the Khalil
Gibran Academy,•the
burg:eoning anti-M sliin
movement succeeded in
forcing city leaders to bend
to its will, and having
learned just how to do that,
then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets.
As the ,New York Times
s!..t_..at the time, ""The
fight against the school...
was only an early skirmish
in a broader, national
struggle.""
s a battle that has really
just begun."" Pipes told the
Times.
From Scam to Publicity
Coup
Pipes couldn't have been
more on the mark. In late
2009, the Isiamophobes
sprang into action again
when the Cordoba Initiative,
a non-profit Muslim group
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015

headed by Feisai Abdul
Rauf, an exceedingly
moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly
lepic,,etiting the
United States at the behest
of the State Department,
announced that it was going
to build a community center
in downtown New ""NCork
City. With the help of
investors, Raufs Cordoba
Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground
Zero in Manhattan. The
space was to contain a
prayer area as part of a large
community center that
would be open to everyone
in the neighborhood.
None of these facts mattered
to Pamela Geller. Thanks to

made Cordoba's
construction plans a national
issue, provokino fervent

to fast-food joints didn't

against Cordoba House
earned the 52-year-old full-
time blogger the attention
she apparently craved.,
including a • 1 in
the Neu, York ThIleS and
frequent cable news spots,

News.
Mainstream reporters tended
to focus on Geller's bizarre
stunts. She posted a video

instance, while ranting about
""left-tards"" and ""Nazi
Hezbollah."" Her gall for
boycotting Campbell's Soup
because the company

food is under Jewish law) --
versions of its products got
her much attention, as did
her .cron-lotior of a screed
claiming that President
Barack Obama was the
illegitimate lovechild of
Malcolm X.
Geller had never earned a
living as a journalist. She
supported herself with
millions of dollars in a
divorce settlement and life
insurance money from her
ex-husband. He died in
2008, a year after being
for an alleged $1.3
million scam he was
accused of-running out of a
car dealership he co-owned
with Geller. Independently
wealthy and with time on
her hands, Geller proved
able indeed when it came to
exploiting her strange media
stardom to in.cite the already
organized political network
of islamophobes to intensify
their crusade.
She also benefited from
close alliances with leading
islamophobes from Europe.
Among Ocher's allies was
Andrew Gravers, a Danish
activist who formed the
group Stop the
Islamicization of Europe,
and :.1a.-ye it the unusually
blunt motto: ""Racism is the
lowest form of human
stupidity, but Islamophobia
is the height of common

sense."" Gravers' group
inspired Geller's own U.S.-
based outfit, Stop the
Islamicization of America,
which she formed with her
friend Robert Spencer, a
pseudo-scholar whose
bestselling books, including
The Truth About
Muhammad, Founder of the
World's Most Intolerant
Religion, prompted former
advisor to President Richard
Nixon and Muslim activist
Robert Crane to ca/1
""the principal leader... in
the new academic .field of
Muslim bashing.""
(According to the website
almost $1 million
in donations from Chernick
has been steered to
Spencer's Jihad Watch
group through David
Horowitz's Freedom
Center.)
Perfect sources for
Republican political figures
in search of the next hot-
button cause, their rhetoric
found its way into the
talking points of Newt
Gingrich and Sarah Patin as
they propelled the crusade
against Cordoba House into
the national spotlight.
Gingrich soon pared the
community center to a Nazi
sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while
Patin called it ""a stab in the
heart"" of ""the Heartland.""
Meanwhile, Tea Party
candidates like Republican
Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war
veteran who killed two
unarmed Iraqi civilians,
shooting them 60 times -- he
even stopped to reload
made their opppsition to
Cordoba House the

centerpiece of midterm
congressional campaigns
conducted hundreds of miles
from Ground Zero.
Geller's campaign against
""the mosque at Ground
Zero"" gained an unexpected
assist and a veneer of
legitimacy from established
Jewish leaders like Anti-
Defamation League
National Director Abraham
Foxman. ""Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to
feelings that are irrational,""
he et.:narked to the New
York Times. Comparing the
bereaved family members of
9-1 1 victims to Holocaust
survivors, Foxman insisted,
""Their anguish entitles them
to positions that others
would categorize as
irrational or bigoted.""
Soon enough, David Harris,
director of the (Chernick-
funded) American Jewish
Committee, was demanding
that Cordoba's leaders be
compelled to reveal their
""true attitudes"" about
Palestinian militant groups
before construction on the
center was initiated. Rabbi
Marvin Hier of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los
Angeles, another major
Jewish group, insisted it
would be ""insensitive"" for
Cordoba to build near ""a
cemetery,"" though his
organization had recently
been granted permission
from the municipality of
Jerusalem to build a
""museum of tolerance"" to be
called The Center for
Human Dignity directly on
top of the Mamilla
Cemetery, a Muslim
Graveyard that contained

thousands of grave sites
dating back 1,200 years.
Inspiration from Israel
It was evident from the
involvement of figures like
Gravers that the
Islamophobic network in the
United States represented a
trans-Atlantic expansion of
simmering resentment in
Europe. There, the far-right
was storming to victories in
parliamentary elections
across the continent in part
by appealing to the
simmering anti-Muslim
sentiments of voters in rural
and working-class
communities. The extent of
the collaboration between
European and American
Islamophobes has only
continued to grow with
Geller, Spencer, and even
Gingrich standing beside
Europe's most prominent
anti-Muslim figure, Dutch
pad iamentarian Geed
Wilders, at a rally against
Cordoba House. In the
meantime. Geller was
issuing statements of
sunport for the Emdish
Defense League, a band of
uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis
and former members of the
whites-only British National
Party who intimidate
Muslims in the streets of
cities like Birmingham and
London.
In addition, the trans-
Atlantic Islamophobic
crusade has stretched into
Israel, a country that has
come to symbolize the
network's fight against the
Muslim menace. As Geller
told the New York Times'
Alan Feuer, Israel is ""a very
good guide because, like I
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015

said, in the war between the
civilized man and the
savage, you side with the
civilized man.""
EDL members regularly
wave Israeli flags at their
rallies, while Wilders claims
to have formed his views
about Muslims during the
time he worked on an Israeli
cooperative farm in the
1980s. He has, he says,
visited the country more
than 40 times since to meet
with rightist political allies
like Aryeh Eldad, a member
of the Israeli Knesset and
leader of the far right
Hatikvah faction of the
National Union Party. He
has called for forcibly
""transferring"" the
Palestinians living in Israel
and the occupied West Bank
to Jordan and Egypt. On
December 5th, for example,
Wilders traveled to Israel for
a 'ffrjend nieei,imr, with
Foreign Minister Avi2clor
Lieberman, then declared at
a press conference that
Israel should annex the West
Bank and set up a
Palestinian state in Jordan.
In the apocalyptic clash of
civilizations the global anti-
Muslim network has sought
to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar,
located on the hills above
the occupied Palestinian city
of Nablus, represent front-
line fortresses. Inside
Yitzar's state-funded
yeshiva, a rabbi named
Yitzhak Shapira has
instructed students in what
rules must be applied when
considering killing non-
Jews. Shapira summarized
his opinions in a widely
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
publicized book. Torat
HaMelech, or The King's
Torah. Claiming that non-
Jews are ""uncompassionate
by nature,"" Shapira cited
rabbinical texts to declare
that gentiles could be killed
in order to ""curb their evil
inclinations."" ""There is
justification,"" the rabbi
proclaimed, ""for killing
babies if it is clear that they
will grow up to harm us, and,
in such a situation they' may
be harmed deliberately, and
not only during combat with
adults.""
In 2006, the rabbi was
briefly held by Israeli police
for urging his supporters to
murder all Palestinians over
the age of 13. Two years
later, according to the Israeli
newspaper Ilaaretz, he
a rabbinical letter in
support of Israeli Jews who
had brutally assaulted two
Arab youths on the country's
Holocaust Remembrance
Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a
suspect in helping
a rocket attack
against a Palestinian village
near Nablus.
Though he was not charged,
his name came up again in
connection with another act
of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police
raided his settlement
seeking vandals who had set
fire to a nearby mosque.
One of Shapira's followers,
an American immigrant,
Jack _Mite"", has confessed to
murdering two innocent
Palestinians and attempting
to the kill the liberal Israeli
historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.

What does all this have to
do with Islamophobic
campaigns in the United
States? A great deal,
actually. Through New
York-based tax-exempt non-
profits like the Central Fund
of Israel and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the
omnipresent Aubrey
Chernick has sent tens of
thousands of dollars to
support the Yitzar
settlement, as well as to the
messianic settlers dedicated
to ""Judaizing"" East
Jerusalem. The settlement
movement's leading online
news magazine. Arutz
Sheva, has feattired Geller
as a columnist. A friend of
Geller's, Beth Gili.nsky, a
right-wing activist with a
group called the Coalition to
Honor Ground Zero and the
founder of the Jewish
Action Alliance (apparently
ttun. out of a Manhattan real
estate office), organized a
large rally in New York City
in April 2010 to protest the
Obama administration's call
for a settlement freeze.
Among Chemick's major
funding recipients is a
supposedly ""apolitical""
group called Aish. Hatorah
that claims to educate Jews
about their heritage. Based
in New York and active in
the fever swamps of
northern West Bank
settlements near Yitzar,
Aish Hatorah shares an
address and staff with a
shadowy foreign non-profit
called the Clarion Fund.
During the 2008 U.S.
election campaign, the
Clarion Fund distributed 28
million DVDs of a

Obsession as newspaper
inserts to residents of swing
states around the country.
The film featured a who's
who of anti-Muslim
activists, including \Valid
Shoebat, a self-proclaimed
""former PLO terrorist.""
Among Shoebat's more
striking statements: ""A
secular dogma like Nazism
is less dangerous than is
Islamofascism today."" At a
Christian gathering in 2007,
this ""former Islamic
terrorist"" told the crowd that
Islam was a ""satanic cult""
and that he had been born
again as an evangelical
Christian. In 2008, however,
the Jerusalem Post, a right-
leaning newspaper, exposed
h rn as a fraud, whose
claims to terrorism were
fictional.

impact during the 2008

Representatives in midterm
elections, the network

Muslim runs for reelection,
the country's most vocal
Islamophobes could once
again find a national
platform amid the frenzied
atmosphere of the campaign.
By now, the Islamophobic
crusade has gone beyond the
right-wing pro-Israel
activists, cyber-bigots, and
ambitious hucksters who
conceived it. It now belongs
to leading Republican
presidential candidates, top-
rated cable news hosts, and
crowds of Tea Party
activists. As the fervor
spreads, the crusaders are
basking in the glory of what
they accomplished. ""I didn't
choose this moment,"" Geller
mused to the New York
Times, ""this moment chose

Subject: Lockerbie report tomorrow
PJ-- Senator Menendez and company are released their report on Lockerbie/Megrahi release timed for tomorrow, the
22nd anniversary of the bombing. One of their recommendations that is that the State Department ""launch its own inquiry
into al-Megrahi's release"" to ""exhaustively identify and interview sources"" to determine how and why Megrahi was
released.
Looking for comment...
Im also led to believe that the British govt. inquiry promised by Cameron has in fact uncovered additional documents
showing there may have additional communcations by the Brits to the Scots about the importance of releasing
Megrahi. Im assuming that State Department has been informed about some of this and you might be able to shed some
light...

Our concerns are based on our commitment to universal respect for human rights. We are particularly concerned by the
potential for further violence and repression during the coming days, especially around the anniversary of the Islamic
Republic's founding on 11 February. We call on the Government of Iran to live up to its international human rights
obligations, to end its abuses against its own people, to hold accountable those who have committed the abuses and to
release those who are exercising their rights.

Subject: Israeli air strikes target Gaza after rocket fire (Reuters)
GAZA (Reuters) - Israel carried out a series of air strikes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Authority officials and
witnesses said, after militants from the Hamas-ruled territory fired rockets into southern Israel. No one was
reported killed in any of the attacks. The Israeli strikes targeted a Hamas training camp, where two gunmen
were wounded, smuggling tunnels along Gaza's border with Egypt, and other, unpopulated areas, Hamas
officials and witnesses said. An Israeli military spokeswoman, who was checking that report, said 13 rockets
were fired from Gaza into Israel in the past two days. None of the attacks caused any injuries. Hamas leaders
have tried to curb rocket fire at Israel, but smaller groups continue to carry out such attacks. Israel's military
said more than 200 cross-border missiles, rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza this year. An air strike
in Gaza on December 18 killed five militants from a rocket launching squad.

This is from the political officer in London:
David Cameron will be given the right of reply after the PM's statement this afternoon -- followed by Q&A. UUP MP
Sylvia Hermon is likely to be ""unhelpful"" during the Q&A.
The Conservatives are becoming exasperated by the rumors that appear in the press and elsewhere that they are
unsupportive of the agreement. Our contacts say the Tories have been completely consistent in supporting the
government on devolution, though they don't believe HMG handled the issue well (i.e. allowing the exclusion of the UUP
and SDLP).
Reg Empey is scheduled to meet his MLAs tonight to review the document and prepare for the working group with
SDLP's Margaret Ritchie.

for a 10 minute statement - most believe so he can announce his support for START.
Brown also announced his support for the Treaty this evening. With Alexander, that should put us at the 9 needed
Republicans (Alexander, Bennett, Brown, Collins, Gregg, Isakson, Lugar, Snowe and Voinovich). There are several others
in play (Corker, Chamblis, Cochran, McCain and Murkowski). Moreover, there are bound to be some ""sleepers"" as the
vp called them. This could be Roberts, Crapo, Kirk or others.
We have a meeting in the morning with Kerry, Lugar and Kyl to discuss the remaining amendments. Reid is encouraging
Kerry to offer to vote on a handful of R amendments post cloture, but then move fairly deliberately to a vote on
ratification.
The end is in sight....

Sen. Ron Wyden Has Early Stage Prostate Cancer, Will Miss Votes
Posted Thursday, December 16, 2010 5:06 PM I By David Weigel
<http://www.slate.com/blogs/search/searchresults.aspx?u=2539>
Here is the statement -- Wyden caught the cancer early, but will have to miss votes tomorrow and next week.
After my annual physical in late November, I was diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer. After reviewing all the
options with multiple physicians, I decided to take a proactive approach and have surgery, which will be performed
December 20 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Alan Partin.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773417 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773417 Date: 08/31/2015
Thanks to routine screening, this was diagnosed very early and I expect a full and speedy recovery.
I scheduled the surgery for the Monday before Christmas anticipating that the Senate would have recessed by that time
and that there would be no disruption to my work in Oregon or Washington. However, it now appears that I will be
missing votes tomorrow and possibly next week while I prepare and undergo this procedure. I expect to be back to
work full-time when the Senate reconvenes in January.
If anything is taken away from my experience, I hope it is the importance of getting routine physicals. One in six men
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes. Early detection is critical to catching this disease when
treatment is most effective.
Wyden's vote is one Democrats are counting on for tough votes; he's needed to pass the START treaty, the omnibus, and
possibly the DREAM Act. According to current vote counts, it would be possible for the Senate to repeal DADT without
Wyden's vote -- with the support of key Republicans, vote counters say they're at 61 or 62.

Tomgram: Max Blumenthal, The Great Fear
By Max Blumenthal
Posted on December 19, 2010, Printed on December 20, 2010 http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/
Moments of imperial and economic decline -- according to a recent poll, 65% of Americans now believe
<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38996574/ns/politics/> this country to be ""in a state of decline"" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be spreading through the United States. It's not
so surprising, really. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, fear
<http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175325/tomgram%3A_engelhardt_the_united_states_offear/> has been
injected <http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175206/tomgram:_engelhardt_fear_inc.> into this ""homeland"" like a
drug and a penumbra <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/> of official secrecy has settled over
the land in a way that makes the secrecy of the Cold War years (when this country faced a superpower, not a ragtag set
of jihadis, guerrillas, and terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and hysteria amid declining living conditions, ""explanations"" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a patina of plausibility and so traction.
No wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the financial system seemed on the verge of collapse, as unemployment
soared and a massive wave of home foreclosures swept into view, increasing numbers of Americans became prey to any
wacky explanation for our troubles, none more so than the idea that Islam was somehow responsible, that mosques and
Islamic centers <http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175283/stephan_salisbury_extremism_at_ground_zero> meant
for a sliver of a minority here were capable of imposing anything, no less a way of life on this country, or that Sharia law
(of all things) might somehow worm its way into state legal systems <http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/shariah-law-ban-
oklahoma-renews-debate-draws-legal/story?id=12112985> , or that YouTube was a hotbed of terrorism
<http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageld=239393> worthy of suppression, or... well, you name it.

Max Blumenthal, author of the bestselling book Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement That Shattered the Party
<http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568584172/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20> , has done the necessary legwork to take
us deep into one of those crews of conspiracy-mongers who, at another time, just about no one would have paid much

The Great Islamophobic Crusade
Inside the Bizarre Cabal of Secretive Donors, Demagogic Bloggers, Pseudo-Scholars, European Neo-Fascists, Violent
Israeli Settlers, and Republican Presidential Hopefuls Behind the Crusade
By Max Blumenthal <http://www.tomdispatch.com/authors/maxblumenthal>
Nine years after 9/11, hysteria about Muslims in American life has gripped the country. With it has gone an outburst
<http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175283/stephan_salisbury_extremism_at_ground_zero> of arson attacks on
mosques, campaigns to stop their construction, and the branding of the Muslim-American community, overwhelmingly
moderate, as a hotbed of potential terrorist recruits. The frenzy has raged from rural Tennessee to New York City, while
in Oklahoma, voters even overwhelmingly approved <http://thinkprogress.org/2010/11/11/oklahoma-sharia-native-
americans/> a ballot measure banning the implementation of Sharia law in American courts (not that such a prospect
existed). This campaign of Islamophobia wounded President Obama politically, as one out of five Americans have bought
into <http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1701/poll-obama-muslim-christian-church-out-of-politics-political-leaders-religious>
a sustained chorus of false rumors about his secret Muslim faith. And it may have tainted views of Muslims in general;
an August 2010 Pew Research Center poll revealed <http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1706/poll-americans-views-of-
muslims-object-to-new-york-islamic-center-islam-violence> that, among Americans, the favorability rating of Muslims
had dropped by 11 points since 2005.
Erupting so many years after the September 11th trauma, this spasm of anti-Muslim bigotry might seem oddly
timed and unexpectedly spontaneous. But think again: it's the fruit of an organized, long-term campaign by a tight
confederation of right-wing activists and operatives who first focused on Islamophobia soon after the September 11th
attacks, but only attained critical mass during the Obama era. It was then that embittered conservative forces, voted
out of power in 2008, sought with remarkable success to leverage cultural resentment into political and partisan gain.
This network is obsessively fixated on the supposed spread of Muslim influence in America. Its apparatus spans
continents, extending from Tea Party activists here to the European far right. It brings together in common cause right-
wing ultra-Zionists, Christian evangelicals, and racist British soccer hooligans. It reflects an aggressively pro-Israel
sensibility, with its key figures venerating the Jewish state as a Middle Eastern Fort Apache on the front lines of the
Global War on Terror and urging the U.S. and various European powers to emulate its heavy-handed methods.
Little of recent American Islamophobia (with a strong emphasis on the ""phobia"") is sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock troops massed for angry protests outside the proposed site of an Islamic community center in
lower Manhattan, representatives of the Israel lobby and the Jewish-American establishment launched a campaign
against pro-Palestinian campus activism that would prove a seedbed for everything to come. That campaign quickly --
and perhaps predictably -- morphed into a series of crusades against mosques and Islamic schools which, in turn,
attracted an assortment of shady but exceptionally energetic militants into the network's ranks.
Besides providing the initial energy for the Islamophobic crusade, conservative elements from within the pro-Israel
lobby bankrolled the network's apparatus, enabling it to influence the national debate. One philanthropist in particular
has provided the beneficence to propel the campaign ahead. He is a little-known Los Angeles-area software security
entrepreneur named Aubrey Chernick, who operates out of a security consulting firm blandly named the National
Center for Crisis and Continuity Coordination. A former trustee of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which
has served as a think tank for the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a frontline lobbying group for Israel,
Chernick is said to be worth $750 million.
Chernick's fortune is puny compared to that of the billionaire Koch Brothers
<http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer> , extraction industry titans who fund Tea
Party-related groups like Americans for Prosperity, and it is dwarfed by the financial empire of Haim Saban, the Israeli-
American media baron who is one of the largest private donors
<http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/10/100510fa_fact_bruck> to the Democratic party and recently
matched <http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/haim_saban_andrea_bocelli_add_up_to_9_million-
dollar-nightfor_fidf_2010121/> $9 million raised for the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces in a single night.

However, by injecting his money into a small but influential constellation of groups and individuals with a narrow
agenda, Chernick has had a considerable impact.
Through the Fairbrook Foundation
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0910/The_Park51_money_trail.html?showall> , a private entity he and his
wife Joyce control, Chernick has provided funding to groups ranging from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and
CAMERA, a right-wing, pro-Israel, media-watchdog outfit, to violent Israeli settlers living on Palestinian lands and figures
like the pseudo-academic author Robert Spencer, who is largely responsible for popularizing conspiracy theories about
the coming conquest of the West by Muslim fanatics seeking to establish a worldwide caliphate. Together, these groups
spread hysteria about Muslims into Middle American communities where immigrants from the Middle East have
recently settled, and they watched with glee as likely Republican presidential frontrunners from Mike Huckabee to Sarah
Palin promoted <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbUxcgrgUnE&feature=related> their cause and parroted
<http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/07/18/sarah-palin-to-muslims-reject-ground-zero-mosqueh their tropes. Perhaps
the only thing more surprising than the increasingly widespread appeal of Islamophobia is that, just a few years ago, the
phenomenon was confined to a few college campuses and an inner city neighborhood, and that it seemed like a fleeting
fad that would soon pass from the American political landscape.
Birth of a Network
The Islamophobic crusade was launched in earnest at the peak of George W. Bush's prestige when the
neoconservatives and their allies were riding high. In 2003, three years after the collapse of President Bill Clinton's
attempt to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue and in the immediate wake of the invasion of Iraq, a network of Jewish
groups, ranging from ADL and the American Jewish Committee to AIPAC, gathered to address what they saw as a sudden
rise in pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses nationwide. That meeting gave birth to the David Project, a campus
advocacy group led by Charles Peters, who had co-founded CAMERA, one of the many outfits bankrolled by Chernick.
With the help of public relations professionals, Peters conceived <http://www.thenation.com/article/mideast-comes-
columbia> a plan to ""take back the campus by influencing public opinion through lectures, the Internet, and coalitions,""
as a memo produced at the time by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company stated.
In 2004, after conferring with Martin Kramer, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the pro-
Israel think tank where Chernoff had served as a trustee, Peters produced a documentary film that he called Columbia
Unbecoming <http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/10868/>. It was filled with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia University claiming they had endured intimidation and insults from Arab professors. The film
portrayed that New York City school's Department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures as a hothouse of
anti-Semitism.
In their complaints, the students focused on one figure in particular: Joseph Massad
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massadh , a Palestinian professor of Middle East studies. He was known
for his passionate advocacy of the formation of a binational state between Israel and Palestine, as well as for his strident
criticism of what he termed ""the racist character of Israel."" The film identified him as ""one of the most dangerous
intellectuals on campus,"" while he was featured as a crucial villain in The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous
Academics in America, a book by the (Chernick-funded) neoconservative activist David Horowitz. As Massad was
seeking tenure at the time, he was especially vulnerable to this sort of wholesale assault.
When the controversy over Massad's views intensified, Congressman Anthony Weiner, a liberal New York Democrat
who once described himself <http://www.zoa.oresitedocuments/pressrelease_view.asp?pressreleaselD=228> as a
representative of ""the ZOA [Zionist Organization of America] wing of the Democratic Party,"" demanded that Columbia
President Lee Bollinger, a renowned First Amendment scholar, fire the professor. Bollinger responded by issuing
uncharacteristically defensive statements about the ""limited"" nature of academic freedom.
In the end, however, none of the charges stuck. Indeed, the testimonies in the David Project film were eventually
either discredited or never corroborated. In 2009, Massad earned tenure after winning
<http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/jul_aug08/around_the_quads10> Columbia's prestigious Lionel Trilling Award
for excellence in scholarship.
<http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568584172/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20> Having demonstrated its ability to
intimidate faculty members and even powerful university administrators, however, Kramer claimed a moral victory in
the name of his project, boasting to the press that ""this is a turning point."" While the David Project subsequently
fostered chapters on campuses nationwide, its director set out on a different path -- initially, into the streets of Boston
in 2004 to oppose the construction of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center.

For nearly 15 years, the Islamic Society of Boston had sought to build the center in the heart of Roxbury, the city's
largest black neighborhood, to serve its sizable Muslim population. With endorsements from Mayor Thomas Menino
and leading Massachusetts lawmakers, the mosque's construction seemed like a fait accompli -- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston Herald and his local Fox News affiliate snapped into action. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby
also chimed in with a series of reports
<http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/01/10/the_boston_mosques_saudi_conne
ction/> claiming the center's plans were evidence of a Saudi Arabian plot to bolster the influence of radical Islam in the
United States, and possibly even to train underground terror cells.
It was at this point that the David Project entered the fray, convening elements of the local pro-Israel community in
the Boston area to seek strategies to torpedo the project. According to emails
<http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/W00705/S00149.htm> obtained by the Islamic Society's lawyers in a lawsuit against
the David Project, the organizers settled on a campaign of years of nuisance lawsuits, along with accusations that the
center had received foreign funding from ""the Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia or... the Moslem Brotherhood.""
In response, a grassroots coalition of liberal Jews initiated
<http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/07/05/trustworthy_community/> inter-
faith efforts aimed at ending a controversy that had essentially been manufactured out of thin air and was corroding
relations between the Jewish and Muslim communities in the city. Peters would not, however, relent. ""We are more
concerned now than we have ever been about a Saudi influence of local mosques,"" he announced
<http://www.forward.com/articles/11052/> at a suburban Boston synagogue in 2007.
After paying out millions of dollars in legal bills and enduring countless smears, the Islamic Society of Boston
completed the construction of its community center in 2008. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As Boston-area National Public Radio reporter Philip Martin reflected
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phillip-martin/the-mosque-next-door-what_b_720914.html> in September 2010,
""The horror stories that preceded [the center's] development seem shrill and histrionic in retrospect.""
The Network Expands
This second failed campaign was, in the end, more about movement building than success, no less national security.
The local crusade established an effective blueprint for generating hysteria against the establishment of Islamic centers
and mosques across the country, while galvanizing a cast of characters who would form an anti-Muslim network which
would gain attention and success in the years to come.
In 2007, these figures coalesced into a proto-movement that launched a new crusade, this time targeting the Khalil
Gibran International Academy, a secular Arabic-English elementary school in Brooklyn, New York. Calling their ad hoc
pressure group, Stop the Madrassah <http://stopthemadrassa.wordpress.com/> madrassah being simply the Arab
word for ""school"" -- the coalition's activists included an array of previously unknown zealots who made no attempt to
disguise their extreme views when it came to Islam as a religion, as well as Muslims in America. Their stated goal was to
challenge the school's establishment on the basis of its violation of the church-state separation in the U.S. Constitution.
The true aim of the coalition, however, was transparent: to pressure the city's leadership to adopt an antagonistic
posture towards the local Muslim community.
The activists zeroed in on the school's principal, Debbie Almontaser, a veteran educator of Yemeni descent, and
baselessly branded <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/nyregion/13principal.html> her ""a jihadist"" as well as a 9/11
denier. They also accused her of -- as Pamela Geller, a far-right blogger just then gaining prominence put it
<http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/khalil_gibran_international_academy/> , ""whitewash[ing] the
genocide against the Jews."" Daniel Pipes, a neoconservative academic previously active in the campaigns against Joseph
Massad and the Boston Islamic center (and whose pro-Likud think tank, Middle East Forum, has received $150,000 from
Chernick) claimed <http://www.danielpipes.org/4441/a-madrasa-grows-in-brooklyn> the school should not go ahead
because ""Arabic-language instruction is inevitably laden with Pan-Arabist and Islamist baggage."" As the campaign
reached a fever pitch, Almontaser reported that members of the coalition were actually stalking
<http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/former-arabic-school-principal-faces-defamation-suit/> her wherever
she went.
Given what Columbia Journalism School professor and former New York Times reporter Samuel Freedman called
<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/education/29education.html> ""her clear, public record of interfaith activism
and outreach,"" including work with the New York Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League after the
September 11th attacks, the assault on Almontaser seemed little short of bizarre -- until her assailants discovered a
photograph of a T-shirt produced by AWAAM, a local Arab feminist organization, that read ""Intifada NYC."" As it turned
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773420 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773420 Date: 08/31/2015
out, AWAAM sometimes shared office space with a Yemeni-American association on which Almontaser served as a
board member. Though the connection seemed like a stretch, it promoted the line of attack the Stop the Madrassah
coalition had been seeking.
Having found a way to wedge the emotional issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict into a previously New York-
centered campaign, the school's opponents next gained a platform at the Murdoch-owned New York Post, where
reporters Chuck Bennett and Jana Winter claimed
<http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_UerzwvF7fcSQY8Y0P1In4K> her T-shirt was ""apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the Big Apple."" While Almontaser attempted to explain to the Post's reporters that she rejected
terrorism, the Anti-Defamation League chimed in on cue. ADL spokesman Oren Segal told the Post: ""The T-shirt is a
reflection of a movement that increasingly lauds violence against Israelis instead of rejecting it. That is disturbing.""
Before any Qassam rockets could be launched from Almontaser's school, her former ally New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg caved to the growing pressure and threatened to shut down the school, prompting her to resign. A Jewish
principal who spoke no Arabic replaced Almontaser, who later filed a lawsuit against the city for breaching her free
speech rights. In 2010, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/nyregion/26principal.html?emc=eta1> that New York's Department of
Education had ""succumbed to the very bias that the creation of the school was intended to dispel"" by firing Almontaser
and urged it pay her $300,000 in damages. The commission also concluded that the Post had quoted her misleadingly.
Though it failed to stop the establishment of the Khalil Gibran Academy, the burgeoning anti-Muslim movement
succeeded in forcing city leaders to bend to its will, and having learned just how to do that, then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets. As the New York Times reported
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28school.html> at the time, ""The fight against the school... was only
an early skirmish in a broader, national struggle.""
""It's a battle that has really just begun,"" Pipes told the Times.
From Scam to Publicity Coup
Pipes couldn't have been more on the mark. In late 2009, the Islamophobes sprang into action again when the
Cordoba Initiative, a non-profit Muslim group headed by Feisal Abdul Rauf, an exceedingly moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly traveled abroad <http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_08/025164.php>
representing the United States at the behest of the State Department, announced that it was going to build a
community center in downtown New York City. With the help of investors, Rauf s Cordoba Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground Zero in Manhattan. The space was to contain a prayer area as part of a large community center
that would be open to everyone in the neighborhood.
None of these facts mattered to Pamela Geller. Thanks to constant prodding at her blog, Atlas Shrugged, Geller
made Cordoba's construction plans a national issue, provoking fervent calls from conservatives to protect the ""hallowed
ground"" of 9/11 from creeping Sharia. (That the ""mosque"" would have been out of sight of Ground Zero and that the
neighborhood was, in fact, filled with <http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/16/2010-08-
16_a_sea_of filth_near_ground_zer0_mosque_gets_all_the_press_but_porns_around_corne.html> everything from
strip clubs to fast-food joints didn't matter.) Geller's activism against Cordoba House earned the 52-year-old full-time
blogger the attention she apparently craved, including a long profile
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/nyregion/10geller.html> in the New York Times and frequent cable news spots,
especially, of course, on Fox News.
Mainstream reporters tended to focus on Geller's bizarre stunts. She posted a video of herself splashing around
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TG7DTOkU-s> in a string bikini on a Fort Lauderdale beach, for instance, while
ranting about ""left-tards"" and ""Nazi Hezbollah."" Her call <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/10/17/AR2010101702840.html> for boycotting Campbell's Soup because the company
offered halal -- approved under Islamic law (as kosher food is under Jewish law) --versions of its products got her much
attention, as did her promotion <http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/10/how-could-stanl.html> of
a screed claiming that President Barack Obama was the illegitimate lovechild of Malcolm X.
Geller had never earned a living as a journalist. She supported herself with millions of dollars in a divorce
settlement and life insurance money from her ex-husband. He died in 2008, a year after being indicted
<http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_ufV12j9XnA9Qn0Ukjs8Q1M> for an alleged $1.3 million scam he was
accused of running out of a car dealership he co-owned with Geller. Independently wealthy and with time on her hands,
Geller proved able indeed when it came to exploiting her strange media stardom to incite the already organized political
network of Islamophobes to intensify their crusade.

She also benefited from close alliances with leading Islamophobes from Europe. Among Geller's allies was Andrew
Gravers, a Danish activist who formed the group Stop the Islamicization of Europe, and gave it
<http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/07/sioa-is-an-anti-muslim-hate-group/> the unusually blunt motto: ""Racism is the
lowest form of human stupidity, but Islamophobia is the height of common sense."" Gravers' group inspired Geller's own
U.S.-based outfit, Stop the Islamicization of America <http://sioaonline.com/>, which she formed with her friend Robert
Spencer, a pseudo-scholar whose bestselling books, including The Truth About Muhammad, Founder of the World's
Most Intolerant Religion, prompted former advisor to President Richard Nixon and Muslim activist Robert Crane to call
him <http://smearcasting.com/smear_spencer.html>, ""the principal leader... in the new academic field of Muslim
bashing."" (According to the website Politico <http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=D979BED4-18FE-7082-
A8314DD53412ADF8> , almost $1 million in donations from Chernick has been steered to Spencer's Jihad Watch group
through David Horowitz's Freedom Center.)
Perfect sources for Republican political figures in search of the next hot-button cause, their rhetoric found its way
into the talking points of Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin as they propelled the crusade against Cordoba House into the
national spotlight. Gingrich soon compared <http://www.mediaite.com/online/newt-gingrich-compares-ground-zero-
islamic-center-to-nazi-sign-next-to-holocaust-museumh the community center to a Nazi sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while Palin called it ""a stab in the heart"" of ""the Heartland."" Meanwhile, Tea Party candidates like
Republican Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war veteran who killed <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/26/us-veteran-
killed-iraqis-tea-party> two unarmed Iraqi civilians, shooting them 60 times -- he even stopped to reload -- made their
opposition <http://www.pantanoforcongress.com/posts/video-ilario-pantano-at-the-9-11-rally-of-remembrance> to
Cordoba House the centerpiece of midterm congressional campaigns conducted hundreds of miles from Ground Zero.
Geller's campaign against ""the mosque at Ground Zero"" gained an unexpected assist and a veneer of legitimacy
from established Jewish leaders like Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman. ""Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to feelings that are irrational,"" he remarked
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/nyregion/31mosque.html> to the New York Times. Comparing the bereaved
family members of 9-11 victims to Holocaust survivors, Foxman insisted, ""Their anguish entitles them to positions that
others would categorize as irrational or bigoted.""
Soon enough, David Harris, director of the (Chernick-funded) American Jewish Committee, was demanding
<http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/03/american jewish_committee_also_opposes_mosque/> that
Cordoba's leaders be compelled to reveal their ""true attitudes"" about Palestinian militant groups before construction on
the center was initiated. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles, another major Jewish group,
insisted it would be ""insensitive"" for Cordoba to build near ""a cemetery,"" though his organization had recently been
granted permission from the municipality of Jerusalem to build
<http://www.alzaytouna.net/arabic/?c=1519&a=116500> a ""museum of tolerance"" to be called The Center for Human
Dignity directly on top of the Mamilla Cemetery, a Muslim graveyard that contained thousands of gravesites dating back
1,200 years.
Inspiration from Israel
It was evident from the involvement of figures like Gravers that the Islamophobic network in the United States
represented a trans-Atlantic expansion of simmering resentment in Europe. There, the far-right was storming to
victories in parliamentary elections across the continent in part by appealing to the simmering anti-Muslim sentiments
of voters in rural and working-class communities. The extent of the collaboration between European and American
Islamophobes has only continued to grow with Geller, Spencer, and even Gingrich standing beside Europe's most
prominent anti-Muslim figure, Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, at a rally against Cordoba House. In the meantime,
Geller was issuing statements of support <http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/so-who-are-the-nazis-meet-atlass-
thugs/> for the English Defense League, a band of unreconstructed neo-Nazis
<http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/features/English-Defence-League-Hooligans-Unmasked.php> and former members
of the whites-only British National Party who intimidate Muslims in the streets of cities like Birmingham and London.
In addition, the trans-Atlantic Islamophobic crusade has stretched into Israel, a country that has come to symbolize
the network's fight against the Muslim menace. As Geller told the New York Times' Alan Feuer, Israel is ""a very good
guide because, like I said, in the war between the civilized man and the savage, you side with the civilized man.""
EDL members regularly wave <http://www.loonwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/edl_israel_flag.jpg>
Israeli flags at their rallies, while Wilders claims to have formed his views about Muslims during the time he worked on
an Israeli cooperative farm in the 1980s. He has, he says, visited the country more than 40 times since to meet with
<http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141007> rightist political allies like Aryeh Eldad, a member of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773420 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773420 Date: 08/31/2015
the Israeli Knesset and leader of the far right Hatikvah faction of the National Union Party. He has called for forcibly
""transferring"" the Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied West Bank to Jordan and Egypt. On December 5th, for
example, Wilders traveled to Israel for a ""friendly"" meeting <http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/geert-wilders-meets-
israeli-foreign-minister-lieberman> with Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, then declared
<http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/minister-rejects-wilders-plea-palestinian-state-jordan> at a press conference that
Israel should annex the West Bank and set up a Palestinian state in Jordan.
In the apocalyptic clash of civilizations the global anti-Muslim network has sought to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar, located on the hills above the occupied Palestinian city of Nablus, represent front-line fortresses.
Inside Yitzar's state-funded yeshiva <http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/akiva-eldar-u-s-tax-dollars-fund-
rabbi-who-excused-killing-gentile-babies-1.2137> , a rabbi named Yitzhak Shapira has instructed students in what rules
must be applied when considering killing non-Jews. Shapira summarized his opinions in a widely publicized book
<http://maxblumenthalcom/2010/08/how-to-kill-goyim-and-influence-people-leading-israeli-rabbis-defend-manual-
for-for-killing-non-jews/> , Torat HaMelech, or The King's Torah. Claiming that non-Jews are ""uncompassionate by
nature,"" Shapira cited rabbinical texts to declare that gentiles could be killed in order to ""curb their evil inclinations.""
""There is justification,"" the rabbi proclaimed, ""for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us, and in such
a situation they may be harmed deliberately, and not only during combat with adults.""
In 2006, the rabbi was briefly held by Israeli police for urging his supporters to murder all Palestinians over the age
of 13. Two years later, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, he signed <http://www.haaretz.com/print-
edition/news/violence-follows-removal-of-trailer-from-west-bank-outpost-1.250450> a rabbinical letter in support of
Israeli Jews who had brutally assaulted two Arab youths on the country's Holocaust Remembrance Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a suspect in helping orchestrate <http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/the-king-s-
torah-a-rabbinic-text-or-a-call-to-terror-1.261930> a rocket attack against a Palestinian village near Nablus.
Though he was not charged, his name came up again in connection with another act of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police raided his settlement seeking vandals who had set fire to a nearby mosque. One of Shapira's
followers, an American immigrant, Jack Teitel <http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934103,00.html> , has
confessed to murdering two innocent Palestinians and attempting to the kill the liberal Israeli historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.
What does all this have to do with Islamophobic campaigns in the United States? A great deal, actually. Through
New York-based tax-exempt non-profits like the Central Fund of Israel <http://www.haaretz.com/print-
edition/features/akiva-eldar-u-s-tax-dollars-fund-rabbi-who-excused-killing-gentile-babies-1.2137> and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the omnipresent Aubrey Chernick has sent tens of thousands of dollars to support the Yitzar
settlement, as well as to the messianic settlers dedicated to ""Judaizing"" East Jerusalem. The settlement movement's
leading online news magazine, Arutz Sheva, has featured Geller as a columnist. A friend of Geller's, Beth Gilinsky, a
right-wing activist with a group called the Coalition to Honor Ground Zero and the founder of the Jewish Action Alliance
(apparently run <http://www.manta.com/c/mmzgtfs/jewish-action-alliance> out of a Manhattan real estate office),
organized a large rally in New York City in April 2010 to protest the Obama administration's call for a settlement freeze.
Among Chernick's major funding recipients is a supposedly ""apolitical"" group called Aish Hatorah that claims to
educate Jews about their heritage. Based in New York and active in the fever swamps of northern West Bank
settlements near Yitzar, Aish Hatorah shares an address and staff with a shadowy foreign non-profit called the Clarion
Fund. During the 2008 U.S. election campaign, the Clarion Fund distributed
<http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/J126Ak03.html> 28 million DVDs of a propaganda film called Obsession
as newspaper inserts to residents of swing states around the country. The film featured a who's who of anti-Muslim
activists, including Walid Shoebat, a self-proclaimed ""former PLO terrorist."" Among Shoebat's more striking statements:
""A secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than is Islamofascism today."" At a Christian gathering in 2007, this
""former Islamic terrorist"" told the crowd that Islam was a ""satanic cult"" and that he had been born again as an
evangelical Christian. In 2008, however, the Jerusalem Post, a right-leaning newspaper, exposed him
<http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=96502> as a fraud, whose claims to terrorism were fictional.
Islamophobic groups registered only a minimal impact during the 2008 election campaign. Two years later,
however, after the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in midterm elections, the network
appears to have reached critical mass. Of course, the deciding factor in the election was the economy, and in two years,
Americans will likely vote their pocketbooks again. But that the construction of a single Islamic community center or the
imaginary threat of Sharia law were issues at all reflected the influence of a small band of locally oriented activists, and
suggested that when a certain presidential candidate who has already been demonized as a crypto-Muslim runs for

reelection, the country's most vocal Islamophobes could once again find a national platform amid the frenzied
atmosphere of the campaign.
By now, the Islamophobic crusade has gone beyond the right-wing pro-Israel activists, cyber-bigots, and ambitious
hucksters who conceived it. It now belongs to leading Republican presidential candidates, top-rated cable news hosts,
and crowds of Tea Party activists. As the fervor spreads, the crusaders are basking in the glory of what they
accomplished. ""I didn't choose this moment,"" Geller mused
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/nyregion/10gellerb.html> to the New York Times, ""this moment chose me.""

The plan worked perfectly. Gordon made the speech in the late afternoon. Cameron felt compelled to support both the
deal and the timing. Shaun called Lou Susman beforehand and Susman made a helpful call to Cameron ""seeking
clarification"" an hour and a half before the event.
Now, Reg Empey is boxed in. He's considering his position. It may be that you will have to call him in a couple days.
Shaun will call you tomorrow at a time convenient to you.

In supporting ratification of the New START Treaty, Democrats are siding with
the cross-party consensus view of virtually the entire foreign policy establishment
— including former President George H.W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Gates,
Secretary of State Clinton, and the secretaries of state from the last five presidents.
In opposing ratification, many Senate Republicans are siding with the position
supported by... Sarah Palin.
The individuals in the first group have over a century of foreign policy
experience between them, and have worked closely on U.S.-Russia relations
for decades. On the other hand, Palin can see Russia from her house.
Apparently, that's good enough for many Senate Republicans.

Cheryl, Bellerive hit me up before the beginning of a donors' meeting this morning to say that it's important that the US
troops in country be covered by a bilateral agreement that defines, among other things, their immunities.
He noted that
we have had SOFAs covering every military exercise in Haiti since he has been in government.
His critics have been on the radio
daily accusing him and Preval of selling out Haiti's sovereignty by allowing foreign troops into the country.

Subject: PM Bellerive on Donors' Conference, SOFA, adoptions, migrants, political dilema and more
I was in three meetings today with Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive and he made the following points:
Donors' Confab: The GOH would like to hold the donors' pledging conference in New York on April 15. They have
discounted their original date (March 22-23) because there is an IDB meeting in Mexico City on those same dates. There
is a technical donors' meetings in Santo Domingo on April 14, and the GOH would like the pledging session to come after
it. Bellerive said the GOH would also be open to doing the pledging session on March 31, though they prefer April 15.
Status of Forces Agreement: Bellerive asked me if we could propose to the GOH a SOFA covering US troops in Haiti.
I told him we would consult and get back to him ASAP.

Adoptions: Bellerive signed the two lists of humanitarian parole letters I brought him, 1.4(B)
asking if we are close to finishing all the kids in the pipeline. In a later meeting with multiple donors Bellerive 1.4(D)
talked about the case of the ten Amcits being held for allegedly trying to take Haitian children out of the country withou B1
authorization. He said that this case is in the hands of the courts and that the Executive has no influence over the
outcome, but said it is an example of the GOH's need to control the problem of child trafficking which he said has
increased exponentially since the earthquake. He said the judge has three months to decide the case. He has already
dropped the most serious charge of kidnapping, and now the charges ""only carry a maximum of 15 years in prison."" He
said that the judge might determine that there isn't enough evidence in the case to try the Amcits. He said that the only

power the Executive has in the case would be a presidential pardon in the event they are found guilty. He would not
speculate on whether Preval would consider a pardon if the Amcits are found guilty.
Migrants: He approved the return to Haiti of 62 Haitian migrants detained on Great Exuma and said repatriations should
continue as pre-earthquake normal.
Relations with Dominican Republic: On instructions, I asked Bellerive in private what the GOH believed would be the
appropriate role of the Dominican Republic in donor coordination mechanisms.
Political dilemma: The executive decree establishing a state of urgency expires on February 15 and can only be
extended by Parliament. Parliament has been fiercely critical of the Preval/Bellerive government since the disaster, and
This leaves the
government with the dilemma of how to handle extraordinary disaster needs (such as declaring land of public utility)
after February 15. UN SRSG Mullet encouraged Bellerive to seek a ""full consensus"" with the opposition as ""nothing
short of unanimity"" would be required to address the enormous challenges Haiti is facing.
Bellerive told the donor community that the GOH may soon have to choose between
becoming totally ineffective (which he said they will not do) or taking actions that exceed the authority given to the
Executive by the law (which he implied they are prepared to do). The government is meeting with the private sector to
get their approval of theW reconstruction strategy, recognizing that they will have great difficulty getting a consensus
with the political parties. Bellerive said that the GOH is also evaluating what to do about upcoming elections and
constitutional reform, but implied that they have more time to reach a decision on these matters.
Preval to address the nation: The government is going to designate February 12 (the month anniversary of the quake) as
a day of national mourning and President Preval will make his first formal address to the nation since the disaster. They
are drafting his speech to be part mourning and part the vision of the future. Preval wants to announce that all the
ministries are up and running as usual.
Ministries: The PM said that the Primature and the Ministry of Planning will be moving into the old US Embassy building.
The courts will move into the old USAID building. The plan to move a number of the ministries out to Croix des
Bouquets has met with very little enthusiasm from the main line ministries. They prefer to clear the rubble off of their
properties in downtown Port-au-Prince and either build new buildings (EU is offering to finance) or put up temporary
structures (Canada is offering to finance).

General and specific concerns: Specifically heard from Haiti is that Preval has acceded too much authority to the Vorbe
family.
Second, more general, is that the BAMBAM families (the term, I understand, created from the initials of the 6 leading
elite families) are gearing up to inflate costs of doing things and to try to monopolize to the extent they can. Will
forward in a separate email one or two articles I've seen on this.
I'm off to Trinity to prepare my classes for this week. (A reality of my full-time teaching load). While check email later.
Thanks for this opportunity to share thoughts. Am very anxious to do this.

Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were minimal.
Surely, Haiti has lost much. We all have...
Thoughts for Montreal:
1. This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2. Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30
years was an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3. A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-integrate.
Medical and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4. More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing
the civic service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food production;
restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real future. Also a chance to begin
repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined management. Not the work for NGOs.
5. No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6. The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the
rural areas; saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local
institutions.
7. This must stop; can't happen again.
8. This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.
kenbe. Pa lage. - Bob

I was in three meetings today with Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive and he made the following points:
Donors' Confab: The GOH would like to hold the donors' pledging conference in New York on April 15. They have
discounted their original date (March 22-23) because there is an IDB meeting in Mexico City on those same dates. There
is a technical donors' meetings in Santo Domingo on April 14, and the GOH would like the pledging session to come after
it. Bellerive said the GOH would also be open to doing the pledging session on March 31, though they prefer April 15.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773466 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773466 Date: 08/31/2015
Status of Forces Agreement: Bellerive asked me if we could propose to the GOH a SOFA covering US troops in Haiti. 1.4(D)
B1
I told him we would consult and get back to him ASAP.
Adoptions: Bellerive signed the two lists of humanitarian parole letters I brought him, 1.4(B)
asking if we are close to finishing all the kids in the pipeline. In a later meeting with multiple donors Bellerive 1.4(D)
talked about the case of the ten Amcits being held for allegedly trying to take Haitian children out of the country withoLB_1
authorization. He said that this case is in the hands of the courts and that the Executive has no influence over the
outcome, but said it is an example of the GOH's need to control the problem of child trafficking which he said has
increased exponentially since the earthquake. He said the judge has three months to decide the case. He has already
dropped the most serious charge of kidnapping, and now the charges ""only carry a maximum of 15 years in prison."" He
said that the judge might determine that there isn't enough evidence in the case to try the Amcits. He said that the only
power the Executive has in the case would be a presidential pardon in the event they are found guilty. He would' not
speculate on whether Preval would consider a pardon if the Amcits are found guilty.
Migrants: He approved the return to Haiti of 62 Haitian migrants detained on Great Exuma and said repatriations should
continue as pre-earthquake normal.
Relations with Dominican Republic: On instructions, I asked Bellerive in private what the GOH believed would be the
appropriate role of the Dominican Republic in donor coordination mechanisms. 1.4(B)
1.4(D)
B1
Political dilemma: The executive decree establishing a state of urgency expires on February 15 and can only be
extended by Parliament. Parliament has been fiercely critical of the Preval/Bellerive government since the disaster, and
This leaves the 1.4(B)
government with the dilemma of how to handle extraordinary disaster needs (such as declaring land of public utility) 1.4(D)
after February 15. UN SRSG Mullet encouraged Bellerive to seek a ""full consensus"" with the opposition as ""nothing B1
short of unanimity"" would be re• uired to address the enormous challen es Haiti is facin
Bellerive told the donor community that the GOH may soon have to choose between
becoming totally ineffective (which he said they will not do) or taking actions that exceed the authority given to the
Executive by the law (which he implied they are prepared to do). The government is meeting with the private sector to
get their approval of their reconstruction strategy, recognizing that they will have great difficulty getting a consensus
with the political parties. Bellerive said that the GOH is also evaluating what to do about upcoming elections and
constitutional reform, but implied that they have more time to reach a decision on these matters.

Preval to address the nation: The government is going to designate February 12 (the month anniversary of the quake) as
a day of national mourning and President Preval will make his first formal address to the nation since the disaster. They
are drafting his speech to be part mourning and part the vision of the future. Preval wants to announce that all the
ministries are up and running as usual.
Ministries: The PM said that the Primature and the Ministry of Planning will be moving into the old US Embassy building.
The courts will move into the old USAID building. The plan to move a number of the ministries out to Croix des
Bouquets has met with very little enthusiasm from the main line ministries. They prefer to clear the rubble off of their
properties in downtown Port-au-Prince and either build new buildings (EU is offering to finance) or put up temporary
structures (Canada is offering to finance).

Subject: Murtha statement
You ok with this?
I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Congressman Jack Murtha. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the hills
of Western Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Jack Murtha lived by the Marine Corps credo ""Semper Fidelis,"" never
wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war
and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for
leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call
Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack
would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today
our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed
forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate,
and a true friend. My thoughts and prayers are with them and with Jack's beloved wife Joyce and their family. He will be
sorely missed.

Subject: ROK army to hold largest ever live-fire drill (Reuters)
SEOUL (Reuters) - The Republic of Korea (ROK) army said it will hold its largest-ever live-fire drill near the
military border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on December 23 in a show of force in the wake
of Pyongyang's attack on one of its islands last month. The drill, involving artillery, fighter jets and the largest
number of personnel in a peace-time exercise, comes after the ROK's live-fire artillery exercise on December
20 on the island near the tensely guarded sea border and is likely to infuriate Pyongyang. It will take place on
the ROK mainland.

Cheryl,
I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he had
included in his emails to you, including:
""Rebalancing"" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more even
distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-Prince at the expense of
the rest of the country. Bob thinks that nationwide rebuilding will also reduce the chances of elite capture of the
rebuilding effort, since elites are strongly concentrated in Port-au-Prince.
• Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international
community should establish a new norm of transparency in Haiti, for example, to ensure that there isn't widespread
corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.
• Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the rebuilding is done
by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the country they had before. He
recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign investors and leading Haitian businessmen
(e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business practices in Haiti.
• On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers to
reconstruction.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773522 Date: 08/31/2015
• Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US military
presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the hemisphere for the
United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends that when we do draw down, we
make clear that we will return if needed.
• Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to work (e.g.,
through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular job, are unfamiliar with
showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob though ex-military might set the right kind
of example.
• Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread repatriation of
the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians who never left. This reinforces
wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.
• Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential to improve
education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.

Dear Hillary,
I just arrived back but my heart and mind are back in Haiti I am thankful that you helped me get there and supported
the resurrection of the hospital in just one week. General Keen was key in reestablishing the hospital (and I got to
appreciate MRE's). When we got there there were 1500 patients and 400 corpses in a deserted hospital — our team of 7
was the only group there.... And slowly over the week we have built a functioning hospital again.
Meeting and working with Paul has been good for the soul---- although when I felt I wanted to meet him – this was not
the way...But I think I am in this for the long haul...
Below is an email for President Clinton (it was good to see him and Chelsea and Mark there) I promised to forward this
email by a medical student he spoke to in the operating room .... Desperate to find a way to continue his education.
Attached is picture of him and I in front of the surgery area. And there were 3 more I met a few nights later who had
volunteered since the first days but had not eaten in a week (I managed to gather bag of biscuits from the world food
program from behind 3 padlocks after 1 hours of searching – They slept on the hospital grounds because their homes
were destroyed.
I am not sure what we can do... But I promised to pass this on!
Thank you for who you are in the world.. God bless you!

Mark

I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he had
included in his emails to you, including:
• ""Rebalancing"" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more even
distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-Prince at the expense of

• Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international

corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.
• Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the rebuilding is done
by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the country they had before. He
recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign investors and leading Haitian businessmen
(e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business practices in Haiti.
• On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers to

• Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US military
presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the hemisphere for the
United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends that when we do draw down, we
make clear that we will return if needed.
• Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to work (e.g.,
through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular job, are unfamiliar with
showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob though ex-military might set the right kind
of example.
• Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread repatriation of
the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians who never left. This reinforces
wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.
• Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential to improve
education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.
The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring
down the assembly or collapse the process.
DecIan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.
If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two.
We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure by
Brown's report.

Subject: Draft on settlements ready for UN - Palestinians (Reuters)
BETHLEHEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian Authority draft resolution condemning Israel's West Bank settlement
activity is ready to be presented to the UNSC, a senior Palestinian Authority official said. Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian Authority negotiator in peace talks with Israel, said he expected the resolution would be put to a
UNSC vote in February, after the United States ends its presidency of the council. ""We are not condemning
Israel. We are condemning settlement activities and we hope the resolution will pass,"" Erekat said. He said 15
nations had helped draft the proposal after Palestinian Authority President Abbas requested a UNSC meeting to
discuss settlement building in November. ""Something must be done on the international level to halt the
settlement expansion which the Israeli government is undertaking in the West Bank, including Jerusalem,""
Nabil Abu Rdainah, Abbas's spokesman, said at the time. As the Palestinian Authority has only observer status
at the UN, the resolution will be presented by a full member of the council. Erekat said he hoped the United
States would not use its veto to defeat the resolution and added that if it did not succeed at the UNSC, ""we will
go to the International Court of Justice.""

LA PAZ (AP) - Bolivia has formally declared its recognition of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine.
President Morales says his government ""could not continue waiting with its arms crossed given the problems of
human rights, territory and sovereignty."" A Foreign Ministry official later confirmed that Bolivia sent a letter to
Palestinian Authority President Abbas declaring its support. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she
is not authorized to talk to the news media. Bolivia joins the governments of Argentina, Cuba, Brazil and
Venezuela in supporting a sovereign state of Palestine with borders recognized prior to the 1967 Mideast war.

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.
The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring
down the assembly or collapse the process.
Declan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.
If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two.
We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure by
Brown's report.

Names: Radelet from State to USAID
Posted By Josh Rogin Thursday, December 23, 2010 - 12:34 PM Share
Steve Radelet, who joined the State Department last January to be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's top advisor on
development, is moving over to USAID to be their first ever Chief Economist.
Radelet left his post as a senior fellow the Center for Global Development to help Clinton during the development of the
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which was unveiled earlier this month. While at State he co-led the
QDDR task force on aid effectiveness and helped stand up the Feed the Future Initiative, a huge program that will be
transferred to USAID as part of the ODOR implementation. The Chief Economist job at USAID is new.
""The new position of Chief Economist (CE) will help establish USAID as a global leader for innovative policy analysis,
research, and implementation,"" read an internal USAID email about Radelet's move, obtained by The Cable. Radelet will
be part of the senior management team and report director to USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah.
According to the email, the job will have four functions:
1. Building USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic analysis, especially macroeconomic analysis, 2. Developing a
network of leading economic researchers and development economists, 3. Cultivating a new generation of economists
and research analysts at the Agency, and 4. Providing strategic and analytical support to USAID's work in priority
countries, and implementation of Presidential Initiatives and the Presidential Policy Directive.
Before working at CGD, Radelet was a founding co-chair of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network. He was Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Africa, the Middle East, and Asia from
2000 to 2002.
Read the full job description after the jump:
Chief Economist
The new position for Chief Economist (CE) will help establish USAID as a global leader for innovative policy analysis,
research, and implementation by:
1. Building USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic
analysis, especially macroeconomic analysis,

2. Developing a network of leading economic researchers and
development economists,
3. Cultivating a new generation of economists and research
analysts at the Agency, and
4. Providing strategic and analytical support to USAID's work in
priority countries, and implementation of Presidential Initiatives and the Presidential Policy Directive.
Structure:
The Chief Economist will work extensively across the agency with both the functional and regional bureaus.
The CE will report to the Administrator and be a member of the Senior Management Team. The CE will be part of the
Front Office and have a special assistant and administrative support.
The CE will serve in an advisory capacity to the Bureau of Policy Planning and Learning (PPL) and the Bureau for
Sustainable Economic Growth (SEG). Given the cross cutting nature of the CE's work, and the resources and capacity it
will draw upon from both PPL and SEG, the CE will need to work in close alignment with the leadership of these two
Bureaus. The CE will participate in leadership meetings at both PPL and SEG, and be actively involved in advising both
bureaus. The details of this functional relationship will require further discussion between the CE and the Assistant
Administrators for PPL and SEG.
Build USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic analysis
Conduct focused economic and policy analysis in support of Administrator priorities at the direction of the Administrator
and serve as an economics advisor to the Administrator Enhance USAID's abilities to evaluate and understand the cost-
effectiveness and economic impacts of projects and programs.
Working closely with SEG, build USAID's capacity to incorporate rigorous economic analysis into project design,
implementation, and evaluation.
Strengthen USAID's capacity for understanding innovative ideas from external research and analysis and best practices
from other agencies, and incorporating these ideas into USAID programs.
Strengthen the knowledge base of all USAID staff on development economics through seminars, teaching, and training.
Establish regular development economics training seminars and courses for USAID staff and other staff from the
interagency.
Develop a network of researchers and development economists

Dear Melanne,
Thank you; We, group of women leaders met with Secretary Clinton. It was a short meeting, introduction and photo
opportunity. But, I hope the event send a message to our government that women should be supported. I also think
that the Embassy will consider more vision of women of Kosova.
Secretary Clinton was just remarkable. Her message for our, also Belgrade leadership was clear and strait forward;
dialogue, dialogue, dialogue as two independent states!
The admiration expressed by the population in the streets as motorcade was passing, meeting with PM and acting
President, open meeting with students and media was impressive. She is really inspiration for all.
Maybe was not a right time, but I only wish she has pressed the PM on corruption practices.
Thank you once again for facilitating this meeting.

Dear Melanne,
Hope this message finds you well.
I am trying to follow your work and every time I run into information that involves you as a speaker or presenter, I know
that strong advocacy for the benefit of women is coming for the future.
I am starting a foundation, with a objective to advocate policies on health, environment and human rights. Women in
the region have serious obstacles to access health care and services, and are suffering from a luck of information. Many
preventable diseases are taking its toll because of the lack of information and facilities, especially regarding breast
cancer and cervical cancer. Also, laws on health care do not require for preventive services such as mammography, pap
smear and other preventive services. I am planning to work on different level, not excluding other target groups but
starting with women.
Today, media have announce the visit of Secretary Hillary Clinton in the region, including Kosovo. Is there any chance to
meet with her during short visit in Prishtina? I know she is coming to assist the dialogue between Prishtina and
Belgrade, but she would be even more helpful if she meets me and other women.
New early elections are coming in few months and she would bust our confidence and would support better
participation of women and better election result.
I am afraid that our government officials are going to meet alone and/or be very selective who can meet her because is
going to have impact on the election.
I am not with any political party but would be wonderful and extremely helpful for the support of woman's agenda Is
any chance that you will be coming with Secretary Clinton?

TOWARD A NEW POLICY ON IRAN
BY HEINTZ, LUERS, PICKERING AND WISNER
December 21, 2010
I INTRODUCTION: US-Iran relations are never ripe for an opening
but there is high risk to continuing to put it off. We propose that you
urge the President to instruct you to open a direct relationship with
Iran. That might begin by a letter of congratulations to Foreign
Minister Salehi offering to work with him toward a new relationship.
The burden rests on the US to convince an uncertain Iranian leadership
to come out of its shell. The next few months offer an opportune moment
for a new policy. The 2010 sanctions are taking a toll on Iran but are not
changing Iran's behavior. The Iranian government has moved in a more
repressive direction against the opposition and for consolidation of
Khamenei/Ahmadinej ad power, with an increasing role of the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard.
The Administration has a responsibility and an opportunity now to take
initiatives in 2011 that will diminish the possibility of conflict and enhance
the US role in the Middle East We try to answer below: Why now? What
are the elements of a new policy? How to get started?
II Why Now?
A. The Administration's 2009 moves to reset US policy in the
Middle East and the Islamic world have been well received by
most Islamic nations but undercut by Iran. A US policy of
isolating Iran is comforting and easier than alternatives but it also
weakens the larger US objectives of resetting our role in the region. A
new US policy toward Iran would enhance the administration's
regional strategy and return the US to being a strategic player rather
than a polarizing one.
B. The President's initiatives to engage Iran last year failed. The
Iranian expectations for corrective actions from the Obama
administration have been high. Iran's self image as an aggrieved
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
victim of the US perfidy and efforts at regime change, provide a
partial explanation for the Iranian unresponsiveness. Another factor
has been Iran's domestic turmoil, almost unprecedented since the
1979 revolution. As a result the leadership has been even more
immobilized than usual on whether and under what conditions to meet
with American officials. Now is the time to return with even greater
authority in an effort to talk to the Iranians (C below). EV-Ily novt-isit ,--

ether-oppen4-ani-ties-,
C. Significant US steps toward engagement now would surprise
Iran's leaders. A new policy now would be more effective in
changing Iranian behavior than the sanctions have been. The
multilateral agreements in 2010 to strengthen the sanctions against
Iran have sent a strong message to the Iranian leadership about the
seriousness of the Obama administration. But the sanctions have also
reinforced Iran's determination to stay the course. Iran's leaders
perceive US policies over the past 30 years of seeking to isolate,
punish, threaten, subvert, sanction, intimidate, and overthrow if
possible Iran as a permanent fixture of American foreign policy. They
have been successful in convincing the Iranian public that they are
right. Now is the time to engage the Iranians with a new and
determined US policy.
D. Failure to reach an agreement soon on Iran's nuclear program
will increase the risk that Iran will have the capacity to develop a
nuclear weapon. The decision to continue to deploy UNSC sanctions
as our ""weapon of choice"" for stopping Iran's enrichment of uranium
has failed. This policy has contributed to making Iran's nuclear
program (not a nuclear bomb) a symbol of national unity and pride.
As the UNSC approves more sanctions Iran builds more centrifuges.
This US insistence on having some suspension of enrichment or a deal
on their nuclear program as a precondition for talks on other subjects
has led both countries into a dead end. The resulting confrontation
2
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
seems likely to allow Iran the time to develop a nuclear bomb and as a
result eventually toward potential conflict as the only option.
Although the US has stressed that it is following a two track policy
toward Iran, in fact the diplomatic track has been mainly in the
successful diplomatic effort to expand sanctions. A new US policy
must give Iran reasons to limit its nuclear program to peaceful
purposes. We should consider an approach that provides enrichment
in Iran under international supervision but such a discussion awaits a
US decision and must be coordinated with the other members of the
P-5.
E. The consequences of a failure in US policy toward Iran will
severely damage US interest's world wide. US military action
against Iran is unthinkable as a strategy or as the consequence of no
strategy. Military conflict would gravely set back our programs in Iraq
and Afghanistan, further derail the peace process, and perhaps lead to
a regional war involving Israel, some Arab states and Hezbollah and
Hamas. A new toll of human life in the Islamic world would be
catastrophic for the goals of resetting US policy with consequences
for US interests from Morocco to South East Asia. The consequences
of prolonging the current policy without accomplishing any of its
objectives will degrade US authority and power. Another consequence
will be the missed opportunity to engage Iran in a long term
constructive regional strategy:
1)To put in place a crisis management understanding that will
reduce the possibility of US-Iran conflict in the Gulf or over Iraq and
Afghanistan.
2) To deal directly with Iran over its nuclear program.
3) To help establish a regional security structure aimed at
giving Iran and the Gulf states a greater sense of stability.
4) To build a regional stabilization program for Afghanistan
and Iraq,
5) To carry out a joint program to reduce drug trafficking,
6) To develop a coordinated effort to deal with refugees in the
region.
7) To develop together approaches to weaken the Taliban and
destroy Qa'eda and eventually to weaken Iran's support for Hamas
and Hezbollah.

8) To develop other common approaches to serious issues in the
region where U.S. and Iranian interests are at play — drugs, refugees
are examples.
III WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF A NEW POLICY? The US
should make a determined and carefully designed effort to get the
Iranians to the table. The risks of delaying this relationship are getting
higher. Any new policy toward Iran should begin with the following
characteristics.
A. A new policy must engender a positive decision from the
Supreme Leader and his advisors and thus must be seen to
come from the President and have his full commitment to its
implementation. It must aim in the first instance at defining a
framework of negotiations that address all outstanding issues
between the US and Iran.
B. It must eliminate suggestions to Iran that the suspension of
enrichment or some other ""progress"" on our nuclear demands
is a precondition for any progress to direct talks. The Iranians
still believe that broader talks on a full range of issues with the US
based on mutual respect and justice will only happen if Iran
suspends enrichment. This Iranian posture is partially a reflection
of their paranoia and insecurity in dealing with the US. But fruitful
discussions on nuclear issues are only likely to come after Iran has
determined that the US seriously seeks a bilateral relationship
based on mutual respect for each other's interests, concerns and
role in the region.
C. The US should achieve an arrangement with Iran that would
maximize IAEA and other international access to and
monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. As the US sets aside its
zero enrichment preconditions for any progress in the talks, it
should link Iran's assurances that it will not build a nuclear bomb
to a new agreement. That agreement should provide for intrusive
inspections from the IAEA and multilateral or international
management of their enrichment program.
D. A US offer to cooperate with Iran as an equal partner on one
or more non-nuclear issues will set the stage for more fruitful

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
discussion of the nuclear issue. The US will improve markedly
chances to get Iran to deal seriously with the nuclear issues by
starting with an offer to cooperate on other problems in the region.
The Iranians do not want to ""talk"" or ""negotiate"" with the US.
Small gestures such as direct flights to Tehran from the US and
liberalizing travel restrictions on their diplomats in the US might
help but not change the situation significantly. They want to work
together with the US. The issues that would demonstrate a serious
US intention to work with Iran would be:
a. Create crisis management mechanisms to deal with the
possibility of incidents in the Gulf or in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
b. Renew the cooperation on Afghanistan (that was cut off in
January 2002).
c. Seek cooperation on Iraq (in anticipation of further US force
draw down) building on the bilateral talks that took place in
Baghdad several years ago.
d. Seek cooperation on controlling drug trafficking along the
Afghan border and more broadly.
E. Take actions that will signal to Iran's leaders that the US has
genuinely rejected a regime change strategy. Oral assurances
have not been sufficient. The Iranians have appreciated
President Obama's rhetorical outreach but argue that the
rhetoric has not been matched with any material change in US
actions. Such steps would include a decision to reduce or cease
few-a-per-led-44444w some executive branch actions taken against
Iran, particularly anvsofne covert political military activities (with
the exception of efforts to delay or disrupt their progress on
enrichment) that Iran's leaders might identify as part of the US
strategy of regime change.
F. One way to begin a new effort at engagement would be for the
Secretary of State to send a letter to the new Iranian Foreign
Minister Salehi congratulating him on his new position and
suggesting a willingness to work with him toward a new era in
US-Iranian relations. Such a letter might be delivered directly
through the Iranian Permanent Representative to the United

Nations along with the oral message to the Supreme Leader that
we recommend below.
G. Set a new tone in reciprocal communications including a
moratorium on the rhetorical attacks from leaders on both
sides. The President and cabinet members would constrain their
threats and red lines on Iranian behavior, make clear at every
opportunity that the US does not have a policy of regime change
and agree to open up the entire range of bilateral issues that are
particularly important to the Iranians. Astute subtle gestures on
both sides can diminish the distrust. The Iranian leadership would
be asked to agree to comparable restraint in relation to the US. Our
overall goal is to secure Iranian recognition that we are legitimate
players in the region, have interests and will defend them. At the
same time, we will not seek to destabilize Iran's domestic order.
We can compete peacefully on the playing field of ideas, without
challenging the legitimacy of each other's interests.
H. Establish a formal structure through which the two
governments will communicate directly. But diplomatic
relations should not be sought at the outset. One early priority
will be for both sides to empower a senior representative to
conduct regular discussions on official business. Key
communications should go through one established channel, agree
to avoid informal back channels, and seek progressively to raise
the level of those authorized officials. Each side will want to
establish a bilateral process to manage the multiple bilateral
incidents and problems such as arrested nationals and travel of
Iranian diplomats at the UN. Iranian officials have underscored
their reluctance to establish diplomatic relations for now since they
have a long history of distrust for the purposes and activities of a
US Embassy in Tehran.
IV. HOW TO GET STARTED?
A. The President must find a way to communicate directly
with the Supreme Leader a US desire to open official talks.
6
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
Further written communications alone from the President will
not persuade the Leader that the US is serious this time.
Getting directly to the Leader with an oral message (perhaps
confirmed by a non-paper), delivered at a very senior level, is
important to get through despiteafound the intense internal
political struggles in Tehran over relations with the US — and
over who will rule Iran.
The message to the Leader should declare that President
Obama has designated his personal representative to conduct
official discussions with a representative of the Supreme
Leader. In a respectful tone the message should call for:
• The avoidance of misunderstandings in the
Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq or the Levant that
would lead to conflict.
• Greater cooperation between these two
important states — the US and Iran - in the
Middle East.
• Mutual recognition of the other's legitimate
interests in the area.
• The beginning, without preconditions, of
discussions on cooperative steps on regional
and global problems.
• Mutual recognition that both leaders of the US
and Iran have stated publicly their desire for a
world without nuclear weapons.
• An understanding that the Leader's fatwa
against the building or use of nuclear weapons
could establish an excellent basis for
discussions with the aim of agreement for
greater IAEA access to Iran's nuclear program
to assure the world about Iran's nuclear
intentions and develop an arrangement
regarding enrichment.
• Finally, an understanding of what types of
reciprocal actions might be undertaken by each
side to demonstrate the seriousness of this new
effort to work toward cooperation.

B. Getting this message directly to the Supreme Leader is a
major hurdle. We offer several possible approaches:
• First. A senior US Government official,
perhaps the Secretary of State, would make an
oral presentation to the Iran's permanent
representative to the UN, who is the senior
Iranian official within reach and request that
the message get directly to the Supreme Leader.
This approach would have the advantage of not
appearing to bypass President Ahmadinejad
and provide an opportunity for the new Foreign
Minister Salehi to become a player. It would
have the disadvantage of throwing the message
into the middle of Iran's political disorder and
competitive environment where US
relationships have become a touchstone...
• Second. A senior American, not a member of
the administration, could deliver this message
to a senior counterpart in Tehran. For example
Senator Kerry might meet with Larijani the
President of the Majlis. The advantage would
be that it would enable the President to have ,
deniability should this initial approach prove to
be unproductive or be rejected. But the
disadvantage is that it would bring in a key
player who is a strong competitor to
Ahmadinejad and perhaps not be seen as a
serious US Presidential initiative...
• Third. A senior Envoy from the US or a Third
Country could take this message directly to
Ahmadinej ad, who claims to be the strongest
supporter of closer US/Iran contacts. The
advantage of this approach would be to engage
the second most important player in the Iranian
government. The disadvantages are that it
would enhance, at least temporarily,
Ahmadinejad's stature in Iran's governing
structure and open up even more open
opposition within Iran's power elite.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
• Fourth. A senior statesman from a third
country who has direct access to the Supreme
Leader could be asked to determine whether the
Leader would respond favorably to President
Obama's message. We have in mind someone
like Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey, who is
one of the few statesmen who probably has
direct access to the Leader. There may well be
others in that category such as Oman. The
advantage of this approach is that Erdogan's
stature as an Islamic leader friendly to Iran
might make the message more credible to the
Leader. Another advantage would be that the
initial approach could be confidential and
provide some deniability for the President
should this approach sour or fail. The
disadvantage would be the involvement of a
third country national whose personal and
national prestige would become engaged and
raise the possibility that the President's
message to the Leader might be distorted or
misunderstood. The Iranians see Turkey in a
competitive and possibly disdainful light based
on a history with periods of confrontation and
tension.
C. Should the initial approach to the Supreme Leader prove
successful in setting up-initial discussions between
designated envoys, one possible and ambitious route for the
administration would be an agreement between President
Obama and the Supreme Leader on a structure to manage
the bilateral differences and promote the common interests.
Such an agreement would provide clear direction to each
government on establishing a new tone and spirit in conducting
relations. It would also set the agenda for cooperation on a
wide range of bilateral problems.
D. The administration would need to develop a public
diplomatic strategy in advance of the first meeting of
empowered representatives to explain the objectives to the

Congress, to our allies and friends and to the American
people.
Conclusion: We can give no assurances that any of these suggestions
would work. We are convinced however that given the Iranian
obsession about US regime change policies and the negative
consequences for US interests of not changing the relationship, the US
will have to take the lead in persuading the Supreme Leader and his
advisers that the US generally seeks a new relationship.

Below is from the Economist blogger re efforts w/I EU to discredit Ashton, particularly from the French. Wouldn't hurt to
mention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: ""There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network
against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is
surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much
sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain.""

NOT yet February, and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, is getting
nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation, dropped another
depth charge against the baroness tonight <http://bruxelles.blogs.liberation.fr/coulisses/2010/01/ashton-ne-
r%C3%A9pond-plus-au-t%C3%A91%C3%A9phone-europ%C3%A9en-apr%C3%A8s-20-heures.html#more> . His list of
complaints against her is long, and I have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it
is literally impossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight o'clock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because she
allegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell staffed by
officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laid on the fact that she has
not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see any confidential papers. As a former British
cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tells me the British at least may share just the odd secret
with her.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773686 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773686 Date: 08/31/2015
A senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashton's post would currently be struggling with
teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by the Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There
is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of
former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy
than she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much
commuting between Brussels and Britain.
Finally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he says that it suits the
Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton ""sabotage"" the post. My impression is that the British government feels
Lady Ashton needs a lot of support right now and worries she is not getting enough support, but at the same time
worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefings and advice from British officials, she will be seen as a
British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort of fear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but
it is real enough.
Other charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told by other people.
But most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming from officials close to
Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I can confirm from my own
conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking the same question: why did she take
this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key as possible? That is a dangerous question mark to
have hanging over you.

government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in Haiti, and I join all of you
in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard to
U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed global
food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of our
government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance — in both substance and architecture — has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: ""I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
world."" I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the 1990s
and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is broad
consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food security
and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people and
Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies — the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development — in an attempt to
make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The QDDR will
not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be offering
its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance reform bill
is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong support in the aid
community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are members of the Foreign
Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely rare. It provides an
opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the Executive Branch will
recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and nearly a quarter of the
full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development agency that serves under the
foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best empower her to advance U.S. goals.
A Development Policy Guided by Objectives
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
Even as we reconsider our development architecture, it is vital that development policy is guided by objectives rather
than by how we organize our government to deliver development assistance. We should focus on the big issues — food
scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- that prevent economic growth in a large swath of the world's
countries. Those objectives require that strategies reflect the needs of the countries we are helping rather than the
vagaries of our own budget process, which often allocates funds in response to lobbying pressures, media interest, or
political favoritism. Country strategies based on broad objectives also give us the best chance to avoid dependence on
arbitrary spending targets for specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments not just in
agricultural productivity, but in clean water, infrastructure, basic and higher education, and land titling, to name just a
few factors.
The Global Food Security Act, which I authored with Senator Casey and which Senator Kerry has co-sponsored, reflects
these principles. The food price crisis that occurred in 2008 resulted from a culmination of policy choices by donor and
recipient governments over a decades-long period. That crisis was a wakeup call for the development community, for
international donors, and for policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must be a multi-sector endeavor
that goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek to integrate a variety of approaches and actors. At the
same time, we do not want to delegate responsibility for food security policy to multiple departments. That could
further weaken our already fractured foreign assistance structure. That is why our bill designates USAID, which has the
broad development experience necessary, as the lead agency to implement the strategy.
""Whole-of-Government"" in Perspective
The term ""whole-of-government"" has come into vogue in policy circles. To the extent that the term underscores the
complexity of development problems and the need to apply the talents of a diverse set of agencies to their solution, it is
useful and descriptive. Our government must have the capacity to draw on expertise to achieve vital development
missions without artificial barriers erected by agencies. Many agencies are working together successfully on
development problems in many parts of the world.
But we should not mistake the term ""whole-of-government"" for an organizational strategy. Even if multiple agencies are
making contributions, someone must be in charge, someone must coordinate the activities of all involved, and someone
must take responsibility for inefficiencies and failures.
This is especially important in a development context because of our highly fragmented aid system. The risk is that the
term ""whole-of-government,"" will be used to justify that fragmentation or preserve roles for agencies where they are
not justified. We also must be careful that the whole-of-government concept does not re-define development as a series
of technical decisions — from where to dig wells to which seeds to plant in which soils. Such a redefinition would devalue
the discipline of development, which many practitioners have spent a lifetime studying and testing. We know from long
experience that technical expertise must be grounded in an understanding of development. For example, agricultural
advancement depends as much or more on reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, and engaging civil
society in support of rural development than it does on seed quality and planting decisions. An integrated strategy can
only come from an agency that understands development is a separate discipline, as Dr. Shah has said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance programs should not be the status quo, but rather the
period in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid agency. Even if we emphasize the talents of multiple
agencies, a strong aid agency that can design integrated country-specific strategies is a key to success.
Unity of Purpose
Instead of accepting whole-of-government, or any other organizational model, as the guiding narrative, I believe there is
a more helpful way of viewing the development mission — that is ""unity-of-purpose."" We need to be unified around
common purposes for which we can marshal the appropriate level of resources and variety of approaches. There will be
situations that call for the involvement of multiple agencies under the direction of one government entity. But, the
decision to involve other government actors should be driven by the purpose. Such is clearly the case now in Haiti. The
U.S. government and international actors are unified for the purpose of disaster response. That response involves the
coordination of hundreds of organizations to rescue people and to provide basic elements needed for survival. At some
point soon, the mission will evolve from disaster response to reconstruction to development. We should be asking
whether we will be able to maintain a unity-of-purpose even as that purpose changes.
The Lugar-Casey bill proposes that there be a unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless of the
situation, it is the unity-of-purpose that should guide how foreign assistance is designed. I applaud Secretary Clinton for
adopting food security as a top priority. Her inter-agency team has been working diligently on its Global Food Security
and Hunger Initiative, and Congress has been responsive in appropriating funding. Many operational decisions have yet
to be made, particularly decisions relating to coordination, but I stand ready to work with the Administration to pass the
Lugar-Casey bill as soon as possible. I look forward to achieving a unity-of-purpose between Congress and the
Administration on food security.
These are not easy issues to solve. I applaud all of you here tonight for your dedication to development and your
willingness to work with Congress and the Administration as we try to rebuild our assistance infrastructure. I would
conclude with a quote from Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and Father of the Green Revolution, whose
optimism never flagged. He believed that constant striving would eventually wear down all obstacles. He said, ""I cannot
emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress depends on intelligent, integrated and persistent effort by
government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators and communication agencies."" That is as true today as
when he said it 39 years ago, and I invite everyone here to make their own contributions in that spirit.

Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership — Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer — for the
work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its new
Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging crises

The secretary had her picture taken with the 4 women right before her press conference. She met them as she walked
to the site, and then invited them to walk with her to the press conference. The four Afghan women sat together during
the conference and the Secretary asked them to rise so she could acknowledge and applaud their courageous work
promoting women's rights in Afghanistan. We will send some photos around. Cheers, P

She is in London and in contact with the 4 Afghan Civil Society Women representatives observing today's
conference, and understands here is a possibility of a,photo/pull aside for the Afghan women with the Secretary.
Of the Afghan women, three are at the media center, and one is at the civil society conference. Saba doesn't have a way
to access the media canter/Lancaster House. If the Secretary can do this photo opp/pull aside, someone would need to
rine_t_ancli escort the women. Two of the women have local cell numbers:
Hope you can help to coordinate with Saba and 4 Afghan women.

coordinate with Huma and Philippe on this. Sarah Jane-Mayhew, our official photographer, will be at the media center at

Subject: Haiti
I had a group call me today... It is ""F & B Catering"" who have an agreement they are working to finalize with the
International Disaster Relief Fund... One of the principles is Craig Fant. Their operation is on the Gulf Coast. The
agreement would be to provide meals to 120,000 folks a day for a year in Haiti. I did a good bit of due diligence thru the
afternoon with contacts I have on the coast, in Jackson and in the Delta (the ag region) and these folks did a lot of the
Katrina work and have the staging facilities in Gulfport to move their goods to Haiti... the facility, in fact, was built with
Katrina money as part of the single largest FAA grant in history... this airport is used as the staging and departure area
for troops going to Afghanistan... the cargo terminals and personnel are equipped and experienced in this type of work.
Also, there has been a solid, transparent and deliberate effort by this company to work with and buy products from
minority farmers in the Delta... I don't know your politics, etc. I don't know the details on your end, boss... I get so many
requests each month wanting me to offer good words, etc. to you on behalf of some entity... most of the time it's all
about the dollar signs I see in their eyes... I ignore them... but my discovery process of F & B Catering, their Katrina work,
the confidence in their capacity, the use of post Katrina federally funded facilities and the commitment to minority
farmers was all compelling... so I share! Thanks, ma'am.

Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.
The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish
language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.

The Big (Military) Taboo
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government
spending that Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
•The United States spends nearly as much on military power as every other country in the world
combined, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend
more than six times as much as the country with the next highest budget, China.
•The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a
legacy of a world war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany,
Russia might invade?
•The intelligence community is so vast that more people have ""top secret"" clearance than live in
Washington, D.C.
•The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year, adjusting for inflation, than we spent
on the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the
Spanish-American War combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized
new directions, requested about 6 percent more for the military this year than at the peak of the Bush
administration.

""Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime
in, they'll lose votes,"" said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston
University. He is author of a thoughtful recent book, ""Washington Rules: America's Path to
Permanent War.""
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich
knows well. His son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But
the implication is that we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we
have a billionaire military and a pauper diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its
marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign service — and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is
that military power often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea
or an Iran that is on the nuclear path. Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often
counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they
would enhance American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama
bin Laden into attacking the U.S. In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American
security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our money have been better spent helping
American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against
overinvestment in arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: ""Every
gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from
those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."" And in the Obama
administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that military spending on things
large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has argued
most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there
because they see firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And
here's the trade-off: For the cost of one American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build
about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting
money for armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a
signature project, the quadrennial diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis
on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.

""Leading through civilian power saves lives and money,"" Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right.
The review is a great document, but we'll see if it can be implemented — especially because House
Republicans are proposing cuts in the State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in
many ways: financing research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime
later, boosting support for community colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of
Americans than a military base in Germany.

The Big (Military) Taboo
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

per>
We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government spending that
Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
• The United States spends nearly as much on military power
<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trends> as every other country in the world combined,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend more than six times as much
<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trendgraphs/Top1Obubble/top1Obubble2009/image_vi
ewfullscreen> as the country with the next highest budget, China.
• The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a legacy of a world
war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany, Russia might invade?
• The intelligence community is so vast that more people have ""top secret"" clearance than live in Washington, D.C.
• The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/opinion/29kristof.html>, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the
Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War
combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized new directions,
requested about 6 percent <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/us/politics/23budget.html? _r=3> more for the
military this year than at the peak of the Bush administration.
""Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime in, they'll lose
votes,"" said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston University. He is author of a
thoughtful recent book, ""Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War.""
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich knows well. His
son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But the implication is that
we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we have a billionaire military and a pauper

diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign
service — and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is that military power
often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea or an Iran that is on the nuclear path.
Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they would enhance
American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden into attacking the U.S.
In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our
money have been better spent helping American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against overinvestment in
arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: ""Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are
cold and are not clothed."" And in the Obama administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that
military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has
argued most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there because they see
firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And here's the trade-off: For the cost of one
American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting money for
armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a signature project, the quadrennial
diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.
""Leading through civilian power saves lives and money,"" Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right. The review is a great
document, but we'll see if it can be implemented — especially because House Republicans are proposing cuts in the
State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in many ways: financing
research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime later, boosting support for community
colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of Americans than a
military base in Germany.

Cheryl -
Please accept my thanks for your help and the help of your excellent
staff,
especially Nora, when I became ill in Cairo earlier this week. We are
home
now and I am doing better. I am grateful to Mary Grandfield and others
at
the Embassy, with special thanks to Mark Perry who was very attentive
and
extremely helpful. He called repeatedly to check up on me and, very
importantly, arranged help at the Cairo airport.
It is a real comfort to be able to call on old friends and to get such a
positive response.
With thanks and all good wishes,
Howard

JERUSALEM (AP) - Speaking to Israeli Channel 10 TV December 27, Benjamin Netanyahu said if
negotiations stall over Jerusalem or Palestinian refugees, ""it could be that the result will then be an interim
agreement."" On December 26 Israel's hard-line Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman floated the same proposal.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the interim agreement idea is ""a nonstarter and will not fly.""

The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on

JALALABAD (AFP) — A Taliban-style bomb attack killed a district governor in eastern Afghanistan on October 22, police
said. Khorsheed, the governor of Dur Baba in Nangarhar province, was driving to work when the improvised-explosive
device often used in insurgent attacks blew up his vehicle, said police spokesman Colonel Abdul Ghafour. Like many
Afghans, the official had only one name. ""The district governor has been martyred. Three other people, his driver and
guards have been injured,"" Ghafour told AFP. He could not say who was behind the attack, but the tactics were typical
of the Taliban.

PESHAWAR (AP) - A local government official said a suicide car bomber attacked a tribal police patrol in northwestern
Pakistan, killing 10 policemen. Rasheed Khan says the attacker rammed his car into a vehicle carrying the police on a
main highway in the Khyber tribal area near the Afghan border. Another 15 people were injured in the attack. No
group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants often target Pakistani security forces.

She ""wouldn't put a full stop on it,"" though things are looking very good. Tomorrow will be a down day and they'll

I'll be in touch with other people in the morning and give you there reports.

Re: NI breakthrough
Shaun has just called me—about 9 p.m. EST. He says it is very likely that an agreement will be announced on Monday.
The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on
Monday for a ceremony if all goes according to plan now. He will mention your role. You should be prepared to speak to
the parties before the event and issue a statement. Hope it doesn't come unraveled over the next 36 hours.

Missed Shaun, but was just on the phone with his COS, who said there are still some details to be worked out Monday.
She ""wouldn't put a full stop on it,"" but things are looking very good.
Looks like tomorrow will be a down day and then they'll reconvene Monday to try to bang out the last details and
announce.

On the Mitchell material, for reasons that elude me, the two versions of the Blair statement were done on the classified

Draft Statement by the Secretary as Revised by Senator Mitchell
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build
the economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest
possible establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, and to support the political negotiations,
Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell to mobilize the efforts of
the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future Palestinian
State; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to encourage further private sector
investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.
Original Draft Statement by the Secretary Submitted by Tony Blair
The United States is determined to bring about a two-state solution. Believes there is a strong basis for doing
so. Believes it can be done by combining a renewed political negotiation with change on the ground, bottom up, as set
out in Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a Palestinian state.
To this end, Tony Blair, as Quartet Representative, will work in partnership with Senator Mitchell to support the political
negotiation by mobilizing the efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity
and future governance of a future Palestinian state; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians;
(3) to encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

From Larry King last night:
; Huma Abedin; Jake Sullivan
LARRY KING: How is the -- it was so bitter -- well, rather bitter in the campaign with Hillary, when they were going at
each other.
MICHELLE OBAMA: Yes, it seems so long ago.
KING: Yes. How are they doing now together?
OBAMA: They're great. Hillary Clinton is an amazing secretary of State. I mean she would have been an amazing
president. She was an amazing attorney. She's a phenomenal professional. And she's proven to be a tremendous asset in
-- in so many ways. So the relationship is -- is -- is strong. They share the same views in terms of international policy and
approach. And we're seeing the outcome of that on the international stage. I think, you know, we can say pretty clearly
that the United States -- the -- the view of this nation around the world has changed. People are enthusiastic about the
potential. Things aren't perfect. We're still a nation fighting two wars. But when we travel around the country, the
excitement and the possibility are palpable. And I think that's because of the president, but I think it's also because of
our secretary of State.

imminent;
Information on whether or not he could travel to Haiti and how to set up a trip;
Information on whether or not he could travel by private plane;
A list of what supplies are needed in Haiti; and
Direction on how to deliver those supplies.
He said he may not travel if he receives an indication that the case of the Amcit missionaries would be decided
sometime in the next few days.
H has been informed. Please let us know if you would like us to forward to Cor M.

ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since
closed its doors By Emily Belz
WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother
Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National Prayer
Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last Thursday Clinton
described Mother Teresa ""beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,"" seemingly oblivious that the
Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly
to ""cut through all the red tape,"" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a
pastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the
Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. ""I'm not sure the
legal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,"" said
Maureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour
has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining
three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.""This has
been a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,"" said Chuck Johnson, chief
operating officer of the National Council for Adoption. ""It's an issue she's been consistent on.""During her speech on
Thursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother
Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, ""Any country that
accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want."" Mother Teresa then

called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: ""Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the
child.""The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not
stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,
sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.""She told me that she knew that we had a
shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,"" Clinton related last
Thursday. ""And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies
here in Washington.""Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,
no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for
Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant
mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity
in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said
she couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who
are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She
added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. ""We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there
because it's a rich neighborhood,"" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with
AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.

Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, ""Any country that
accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want."" Mother Teresa then

called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: ""Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the
child.""The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not
stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,
sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.""She told me that she knew that we had a
shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,"" Clinton related last
Thursday. ""And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies
here in Washington.""Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,
no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for
Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant
mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.) called the Missionaries of Charity
in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said
she couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who
are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She
added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. ""We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there
because it's a rich neighborhood,"" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with
AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.

Interesting observations from Declan:
Foster was a critical component in the talks apparently. However there is already'speculation that PR may use this
moment to try to come back early and resume position of FM given that the other investigations have been delayed
pending the outcome of the police investigation. He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife, who is in
a clinic there apparently.
Empey still not on board apparently so the ""community confidence"" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.
Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That, coupled with
the jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentary
supporting what we said, seems to have made people realize, that they couldn't lose the moment.

Former president Clinton on mission to rescue Democratic Party in fall
elections
By Philip Rucker
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, October 22, 2010; 12:01 AM
Bill Clinton is baffled. The former president's friends say he is in disbelief that in the closing weeks of the
midterm campaigns Democrats have failed to articulate a coherent message on the economy and, worse, have
allowed themselves to become ""human pinatas.""
So Clinton is deploying himself on a last-ditch, dawn-to-dusk sprint to rescue his beleaguered party. And as the
only president in modern times who has balanced the federal budget, he is leveraging his credibility to become
one of the most fierce defenders of President Obama's economic policies.
""To hear the Republicans tell it, from the second President Obama took his hand off the Bible taking the oath of
office, everything that happened after that was his fault,"" Clinton said this week at a campaign rally for Sen.
Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""I'd like to see any of you get behind a locomotive going straight downhill at 200
miles an hour and stop it in 10 seconds.""
If there was any doubt that Clinton remains the Democratic Party's North Star, it has been erased over the past
few weeks as he has packed legions of supporters into basketball arenas, college quads and airport hangars. He
is the Democrats' most in-demand messenger and, unlike Obama, he is summoned everywhere - no matter how
hostile the territory.
By Election Day, Clinton will have traveled to more than 100 events, including one Thursday in Maryland,
where he appeared with Gov. Martin O'Malley.
Some Democrats are troubled that Clinton, who left office a decade ago, is a bigger draw than Obama and the
party's current leaders. ""Bill Clinton is not going to live forever, and it's time for the Democratic Party to
develop other voices,"" said Bob Rucker, a journalism profressor, as he left a recent Clinton rally at San Jose
State University.

But even with his party out of favor, polls show Clinton is among the most popular national political figures in
the country. His newfound popularity among Republicans is a notable reversal from 16 years ago - when, two
years into his presidency, a GOP resurgence cost Democrats both chambers of Congress.
""Look, folks, I've seen this movie before, in 1994,"" Clinton said at the rally in Everett, Wash. ""I called the
president the other day, and I said: 'Relax. They haven't said anything about you they didn't say about me. The
only reason they're being nice to me right now is because I can't run for anything any more.'""
'Keep on being mad'
Clinton's pitch is rooted in empathy and delivered off the cuff. In Everett, he laid out what he said is the
Republican argument: ""I know you're angry. I know you're scared. . . . So let's make this a referendum on
everything that's bothering you about life right now - take everything that's not working right now and put Patty
Murray's face on it and make it a referendum.""
""It is not a referendum. It. Is. A. Choice,"" he continued, pausing between each word for emphasis, ""a choice
between two different sets of ideas.""
Clinton exhorted the crowd to ""keep on being mad. But concentrate your anger so that it clarifies your judgment
instead of clouding it. . . . The worst thing you can do right now is bring back the shovel brigade to start digging
the hole again.""
No other Democrat has so consistently given voice to the mood of this year's volatile, angsty electorate. Where
other politicians speak of the housing crisis in staid terms - ""Mortgages? I understand homes are underwater,""
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a debate last week - Clinton talks about bad mortgages
as if his family were shackled with one.
""More than 10 million of us are living in houses not worth as much as our mortgages, and we can't move like
we used to do because our credit would be toast for a decade,"" Clinton said at a stop in Espanola, N.M., never
betraying that he is a millionaire many times over and the owner of multiple properties.
Clinton connects with ""how normal 'walking-around' folks are feeling,"" said Paul Begala, a confidant and
former top strategist. ""Both the right and the left have mocked that I-feel-your-pain empathy, but Americans
have always liked it. It's the core of him, even more than the brain. It's real.""
Over the past two weeks, Clinton has had one day off, Saturday, which he spent in Northern California with his
close friend Terry McAuliffe. The two stayed up late, playing cards and drafting new talking points for
Democrats to trot out on the trail.
""He literally sat down with a yellow legal pad,"" said McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, adding that Clinton told him: ""Make sure, Terry, you get these talking points out to every
candidate.""
It was then, McAuliffe said, that Clinton confided that he has been frustrated with the Democrats' message.
""He is just baffled and bewildered about why there has not been a more coherent message talking about what
the party has done, why we allowed ourselves to become human pinatas,"" McAuliffe said. ""I think he is agitated
that Democrats haven't put their best foot forward in explaining to the American public what they've actually
done.""
Student-loan policy

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773862 Date: 08/31/2015
Clinton reserves time near the end of his speeches to talk about student-loan policy change, an Obama
accomplishment he says isn't getting its due on the campaign trail. Clinton bemoans that the United States has
fallen from first to ninth in the world in the percentage of adults with a four-year college degree - because too
many students drop out for fear that they can't repay their loans.
Democrats overhauled student-loan policy to cap monthly repayments at 10 percent of discretionary income - a
law Clinton says Republicans want to repeal.
""Do you know how many working families there are where people go home at night now, men and women and
the children they love better than life, and they're sick with worry, they think they'll never be able to send their
kids to college?"" Clinton said in Everett.
""Oh, yes, you will,"" Clinton continued. ""Do not let this bill be repealed. If the young people of America show
up, we will vote for the future and the bill will be secured. That's why you've got to vote for Patty Murray.
These are real choices here - real, serious choices.""
Clinton, taking time off from running his global charitable foundation, is in the midst of a two-week swing that
has taken him from the Mississippi Delta to the Pacific Northwest and seemingly everywhere in between. It
took him across California, where he put a rivalries aside to join hands with Jerry Brown, running to reclaim his
old job as governor. Aides said Clinton might return to the road next week to visit the battlegrounds of Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Kentucky.
Some assume Democratic leaders in Washington are orchestrating Clinton's campaign activities, but he is
deployed by no one but himself.
Democratic candidates of all stripes are funneling requests and seeking advice through his top aide, Douglas
Band. Clinton prioritizes politicians who helped his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her 2008 presidential
campaign. (As secretary of state, she is banned from political activity.) He also has paid special care to loyal
friends such as Rep. Kendrick B. Meek (D-Fla.), who, despite running a distant third in his Senate race, has
drawn Clinton for more than a half-dozen visits, most recently this week.
The White House and congressional leaders do not coach him on what to say. Clinton does not read from a
prompter and only rarely refers to his notes at the lectern. He gives no interviews with local or national reporters
and on most days races in his motorcade from airport to rally to airport again.
Clinton speaks infrequently with the candidates - in some cases not at all before showing up for an event.
Clinton always has been a voracious consumer of news, especially political news, and aides say he stays up to
speed on their races.
This is evident in his speeches. He devotes a substantial portion to the local issues defining specific races. In
Washington state, he mused repeatedly about a Boeing tanker deal. In New Mexico, he riffed at length about
water use and encroachment from neighboring Texas.
At each stop, Clinton waxes nostalgic, as if he were revisiting an old haunt. At San Jose State: ""In 1992, when I
ran for president the first time, the best rally we had in all of California was here at San Jose State."" In New
Mexico: ""When you voted for me twice, I got to know this state and know its people, and know the unique heart
and soul and dreams, and know the way you accommodate all this diversity and build a common sense of
humanity here. It means something to me. You're special to America.""
After every speech, he flings off his suit jacket and works the crowd. He wraps his arms around folks and listens
for cues about what ails America. Clinton's speeches are bookended by thumping tunes - a Motown classic in
Everett, a Kanye West hit at San Jose State's arena, a mariachi folk song in Espanola.

""I keep thinking I'm too old for this,"" Clinton quipped to a crowd of 5,000 as the sun set behind him over the
open-air Plaza de Espanola at a rally for New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish.
""No! No! No!"" the crowd cried out.
""Then I got out here and started stirring around and realized a lot of people were mad and even more confused,
and I didn't want it on my conscience,"" Clinton said. ""So I sort of loaded up and started strolling around.""

Blair's guy said you ok'ed releasing today. If so, we'll pull the trigger. It is pasted below:
Statement by the Secretary
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will
intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell in support of the political negotiations. In his role as Quartet
Representative Tony Blair will continue, with full support by and coordination with Senator Mitchell, to mobilize the
efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future
Palestinian State, including on the rule of law; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to
encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.
I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close
friend,
According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently
there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had
no choice.
That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his
support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously
and don't carry the ALBA countries' water.
Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had
an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.
Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on
Pinera's support.

Great internet speech based on excerpts I have seen — terrific. Here's piece I did yesterday.
The Huffington Post
January 20, 2010
Strategy Corner: Stopping the Republican Comeback (Déjà Vu All Over Again)
Once again an initially popular Democratic president tries to pass healthcare reform, raise taxes on the wealthy
and expand domestic spending. And once again the voters send a sharp signal that they want him to chart a more
centrist course. As Yogi Berra said ""It's déjà vu all over again.""
President Clinton's wakeup call came with the 1994 mid-term elections -- Obama's came a year earlier with
yesterday's special election in Massachusetts.
In response to the similar situation, President Clinton fundamentally changed everything -- his team, his policies,
and the overall direction and message of his administration. He moved to the center with a balanced budget, welfare
reform, and policies that helped concerned moms raise their kids, leaving behind the divisive bitterness of his first two
years. As a part of that new team then, I saw how President Clinton consciously took his presidency back to the centrist
message of his presidential campaign and relentlessly pursued swing voters; he didn't go small, he went to the vital
center -- 24 million jobs and a balanced budget were big accomplishments.
President Obama now has plenty of time to turn this around before facing the kind of losses President Clinton
did. But stopping the Republican machine now will not be done on the basis of words alone -- it will take actions and
results to calm this electorate.
It also won't be done on the basis of stepped up populist rhetoric. You can't make deals with Wall Street,
Pharma, and other major interest groups and then turn around and make them the whipping boy with any credibility.
No doubt there will be a fight over this in the White House with many inside wanting to go back to the equivalent of
""people vs. the powerful."" Only the voters see the White House as the powerful now and such a lurch would probably
have the harshest electoral consequences next November.
But Obama can turn it around and keep the country moving on a steady path of change if he makes the kind of
significant changes in his direction that President Clinton did. It's all about getting above the trappings of Washington
and being who you said you were.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773929 Date: 08/31/2015
Here's five things the President could do now.
1) Agree to full transparency in health care hearings and other major reform areas -- Obama's original idea to
put them on C-SPAN was the right one. Then go on a major transparency in government binge, seeking out new ways to
bring people closer to what the administration is doing through social networking and other online means. Make
transparency an action, not a theme.
2) Break health care up into its components and move them step by step. The problem with health care is no
one agrees on the solution and this bill is not about the longer lives, greater access and greater efficiency people want.
Break it down and start with the easy stuff like electronic medical records first and work up to the harder parts year
after year.
3) Look for ways to be genuinely bi-partisan instead of seeking the 60th vote through deals and compromise.
Genuine bi-partisanship would have given the Republicans malpractice reform in exchange for a public option -- if you
don't invest the opposition in the outcome, then they have no reason to support it. Just looking for one vote is an
exercise in deal making and compromise that does not live up to the post-partisan promise. Obama's got to call the
Republican leaders and sit down with them, not push them away.
4) Put jobs front and center -- the failure to do this earlier is at the root of the discontent. The administration hit
the 10 per cent tripwire of unemployment and the numbers in the center of the country are dismal -- far worse than
Massachusetts. This means moving the country forward into the new economic world, not trying to take it backwards.
Raising taxes is another flash point now as much of the administration's support came from upper income voters turned
off by the right wing, anti-intellectual campaigns of the Republicans. People need to know there is a strategy for
competing and winning in the emerging global, high tech economy.
5) Don't be afraid to do what some think of as the small stuff -- helping people in their daily lives. Helping people
deal with the new stresses of modern life -- from texting on the road to many working well past 65 -- is not a small thing.
People are again afraid of big, grandiose plans that they fear can bankrupt the country and need to see the government
also relating to their daily lives in manageable, concrete ways. It's the kind of daily activism Democrats uniquely bring to
the White House. This has got to be part of a strategy that returns us to lower unemployment, lower deficits, and
restrained spending.
There will be plenty of time to push back on the Republicans when they get too heady. That day will come as it
did when Newt Gingrich shut down the government and it backfired. But right now the Republicans are not the issue --
the issue is whether the administration has gone Washington and whether it can reclaim the centrist, people-oriented
mantle that brought it to town. And this means taking the administration back to the vital center and fulfilling its core
promises -- greater transparency, less political posturing, true bi-partisanship, extreme focus on jobs and the economy,
and a government that demonstrates daily how really cares about the people.

Re: Saudi Arabia
I have been in contact with Chas Freeman, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and he has sent me his most recent
public speech on the subject. He says the policy part is toward the end, and that King Abdullah's new university (KAUST)
is an important initiative. He also relates that the atmosphere is near toxic because of Obama's failure to follow up his
Cairo speech and the rebuff from Netanyahu. Cynicism, at best, is pervasive among the Saudi elite.
Saudi Arabia: The End of Progress without Change Remarks to the Sarasota Institute for Lifetime Learning
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.) Sarasota, Florida, February 11, 2010
I have been asked to speak to you about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a topic I have never before addressed to
an American audience. Why bother?
We Americans reserve the right to have strong opinions on the basis of little or no knowledge. There are few countries
that better exemplify our assertive ignorance of foreign geography, history, and culture than Saudi Arabia. Most of us

are convinced that Saudis are Muslim zealots, control the world's oil prices, and are absurdly rich, anti-feminist, and
undemocratic. They hate our values and want to destroy us. Talk radio confirms this. What more needs to be said?
On reflection, a lot does. Neither caricature nor a priori reasoning is a sound basis for policy. A distorted view of foreign
realities precludes success at dealing with them. There is much at stake in our relationship with Saudi Arabia. We can ill
afford to get it wrong.
That country is, of course, the heartland of Islam and the custodian of the world's largest oil reserves. It lies athwart
transport routes between Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is at the center of a growing concentration of global capital.
Under any circumstances, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would be important. It is all the more so in an era when we
Americans are at war with ever more peoples in the Islamic world, depend on ever greater amounts of imported energy,
and need ever larger foreign loans to run our government and sustain our life style.
Yet Saudi Arabia is little known. It is the only society on the planet not to have been penetrated by Western colonialism.
No European armies breached its borders; no missionaries; no merchants. Its capital, Riyadh, was long off limits to
infidels; the holy cities of Mecca and Medina remain so today. When Westerners finally came to Saudi Arabia, we came
not as the vindicators of our presumed cultural superiority, but as hired help. As a result, some say that Saudis secretly
see the world's peoples as divided into two basic categories: (1) fellow Saudis; and (2) potential employees. Be that as it
may, foreigners, Western, Asian, or Arab, who have lived in Saudi Arabia all see it as a very strange place — one that is
not easy to understand and that remains at odds with many of the values non-Saudis profess.
The Kingdom has long stood apart from global norms. Its system of government draws on tribal and Islamic traditions
rather than Western models: Its king presides rather than rules over the royal family and Saudi society. His
responsibility is less to make decisions than to shape and proclaim consensus, while assuring a share of the national
wealth to all, especially the least privileged. Saudi Arabia levies no taxes on its citizens, other than the religious tithe
known as ""zakat"" — a two-and-a-half percent annual donation of private capital to charity and other public purposes. All
Saudis enjoy free education and medical care from birth to death and can pursue these services at home or abroad, as
they wish. The Kingdom has no parliament, though it does have elaborate informal mechanisms for consultation with its
citizens on policy matters. Saudi Arabia reverses and thereby affirms a basic principle of American political philosophy.
""No representation without taxation.""
Unlike some other countries in the Arab Gulf, Saudi Arabia has invested its oil wealth at home, not abroad, though it has
long been generous with foreign aid. (At one point it was donating six percent of GDP to other, mostly Muslim, nations.)
The desperate poverty of the pre-oil period is now, at most, a dim memory. Over the lifetime of elderly Saudis, the
Kingdom's per capita income has risen about one hundred fold. Sparsely populated mud-walled villages have grown into
huge air-conditioned cities with 21st Century architecture. Today, Saudis are not just literate; many have university
degrees. There are more U.S. Ph.D.'s in the Saudi Cabinet than in our Cabinet and Congress put together.
Despite rapid development, the strong family structure that characterized traditional Saudi society has remained largely
intact. It is truly moving to see how lovingly children and grandchildren care for their elders in the Kingdom. Saudi
Arabia's unique social stability is reflected in the fact that almost none of its citizens emigrate, though many have second
homes abroad, and a few, like Osama Binladin, have been exiled for deviant behavior..
For a long time it was easier for journalists and academics to get a visa to Tibet than to Saudi Arabia. Perhaps this
accounts for the near total lack of institutions and scholars that study the place. In the United States, 9/11 was followed
by an avalanche of polemical tracts, but there are still very few books about the Kingdom that reflect its realities rather
than the authors' biases or propagandistic agendas. Lack of personal familiarity with the Kingdom helps explain the
repeated prediction by pundits that the Saudi monarchy is in jeopardy. Generations of such pundits have passed away.
The Kingdom has not. When I was ambassador to Riyadh, I was so struck by the apparent social stasis that I briefly
thought the national motto should be ""progress without change."" But in fact change is a constant in Saudi Arabia. Most
of it comes from the top down.

Not all Saudis are happy with the status quo. Some are angry about the extent to which the Kingdom is opening up and
reforming. Others are impatient to get on with reform. The ranks of the latter clearly include King Abdullah bin
Abdulaziz Al-Sasud, the current ruler. Now in his late eighties and on the throne only since 2005, he has surprised
everyone with the vigor of his efforts to modernize Saudi society and to reshape its relationships with the world beyond
its borders. Saudi Arabia has plenty of problems to keep the king engaged.
A lot of issues derive from the peculiar religious heritage of the Saudi state. The current Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (now
over a century old) is the third political structure to ally the House of Sa‘ud with the family of the eighteenth century
religious reformer Shaykh al Islam Mohammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab Al-Tamimi. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's writings form the
doctrinal basis of so-called Wahhabism, a notoriously intolerant and socially conservative form of Islam that is often
confused with other reactionary religious traditions like that of the Taliban. Saudi history has involved a sustained effort
by the Kingdom's rulers to persuade its religious scholars and their puritanical followers to embrace change and to open
up to the outside world. This struggle has mainly been peaceful and virtually invisible to outsiders. Sometimes,
however, it has engendered violence. In 1975, for example, the late King Faisal paid with his life for instituting public
education for girls and for introducing television to his nation.
Both as regent (from 1996 to 2005) and more recently as ruler, King Abdullah has been so careful to avoid drama in his
promotion of change that it is truly startling to review the cumulative results of his leadership. Take women's issues, for
example. In 2002, responsibility for girls' education was transferred from the religious authorities to the ministry of
education. Women now make up 58 percent of the enrollment in Saudi universities. The new Princess Noura bint
Abdulrahman University for Women, currently under construction in Riyadh, will enroll 40,000 students this fall.
Female participation in the labor force is rising rapidly. Twenty-nine percent of women now work outside the home.
(That is a low figure compared to our own but represents a remarkable advance for the Kingdom.) One-third of civil
service positions have been reserved for women. The first woman took her seat in the Council of Ministers last year.
After a bit of a kerfuffie, the Kingdom's religious scholars finally endorsed coeducation at the new King Abdullah
University for Science and Technology. That was big blow to the legitimacy of gender apartheid. A Saudi friend and I are
betting that it will not be long before women in the Kingdom can drive. We plan to clean up by building the separate
road system this may require. (That's a joke, i hope.)
A word abciut the vision embodied in the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology. F6unded by the king last
September with an initial endowment of ten billion dollars, KAUST is an international, graduate-level research university.
It sits in a two-billion-dollar campus on the Red Sea about seventy-five miles northwest of Mecca. On one level, it is the
leading element in an effort to prepare the Kingdom for a knowledge-based economy that can complement and
eventually supercede the current reliance on energy exports. But on another level, it is a powerful answer to the
religious zealotry that terrorist movements like al Qa'ida espouse. Let me explain.
There is a broad consensus among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims that the modern age is ethically corrupt and that
religious faith needs reinvigoration and renewal. Much like early Christian Protestants, many believe that the way to
achieve this is to rediscover and reaffirm the values of their religion's earliest times. When he inaugurated KAUST, King
Abdullah explained that he envisaged it as a reborn Bayt al-Hikma or ""House of Wisdom."" The original ""House of
Wisdom"" was founded in Baghdad around 760 C.E., in the second century of the Muslim era. It was where the Arabs
incorporated Greek, Indian and other foreign knowledge into Islam and conceived much of modern mathematics,
astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology, and geography. It made Islamic civilization the global leader in science and
technology. The ""House of Wisdom"" prospered in an age of tolerance, when Jews and Christians served alongside
Muslims as ministers of government. Though destroyed by the Mongols in 1258, the knowledge it preserved and
developed eventually found its way to Europe, where it sparked the Renaissance.
Today, like mainstream Muslims, the extremists of al Qa'ida and related movements argue that Islam must return to its
roots. But they portray early Islam as puritanical, xenophobic, intolerant, and oppressive of women. KAUST is a living
rebuttal of this historical fallacy and the ideology of hatred derived from it. It was conceived as a new ""House of
Wisdom."" It stands for the principle that Islam was founded as and can only be reborn as the religious guide to a society
open to ideas from other traditions. It represents a call for return to an Islam tolerant of foreign ways, respectful of

women, dedicated to the scientific study of God's handiwork, and committed to the development of new technologies
to better the human condition. KAUST is as much an instrument of religious renaissance and an answer to extremism as
it is an academic institution.
This brings me to the issue of religious tolerance. In 2003, King Abdullah inaugurated what he called a ""national forum
for intellectual dialogue."" This ongoing national dialogue is an unprecedented acceptance of religious diversity in the
Kingdom. It marks an end to longstanding official discrimination against its Shiite minority. In 2007, King Abdullah made
an historic call on the Pope in the Vatican, the first time a Muslim leader of his stature had done so. In 2008 he
organized two unprecedented international interfaith conferences between Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and
others at Madrid and New York. He intends this dialogue, too, to be a continuing process.
There are other major domestic reform initiatives in progress, like a complete revamping of the Saudi educational
system and curriculum, experiments with elections at lower levels of government and civil society, efforts to shift the
Kingdom toward reliance on alternative sources of energy, the development of a huge new petrochemical industry to
complement the production of energy in its primary form. Time will not permit me to describe these developments. My
point is simply that there is a great deal more going on in Saudi Arabia than our press and pundits seem to realize.
That said, everything is, of course, relative. Sadly, to many Saudis, the history of their nation suggests that the more
religiously uptight they are, the more oil comes out of the ground. The Kingdom continues in many ways to belie God's
admonition in the Holy Quran that ""there can be no compulsion in religion."" The open practice of religions other than
Islam remains banned. The status and role of women in Saudi society is controversial and far from settled. Despite
efforts at ""Saudiization,"" foreign workers continue to dominate the employment market, while demanding a premium to
compensate for the discomfort and stress that Saudi Arabia's religiously sanctioned mores impose on them. Methods of
political consultation that worked in a more cohesive and less populous Saudi Arabia can no longer produce consensus.
The fiscal basis of the state continues to be oil exports, and oil is a commodity whose price fluctuates unpredictably.
There is, in other words, a very long list of problems for Saudis to work out in coming years.
Let me turn briefly to Saudi Arabia's foreign relations before reviewing the state of our country's interaction with it.
In foreign even more than domestic affairs, King Abdullah's impact has been little short of revolutionary. He has
overseen the negotiated settlement of the Kingdom's long-disputed borders with all of its neighbors. He brought Saudi
Arabia into the World Trade Organization, ensuring that its trade and investment activities for the first time follow
internationally agreed rules. In 1982, at Beirut, he led the Arab League in an historic reversal of policy toward the Israel-
Palestine issue. Saudi Arabia had long insisted that it would be the last state in the region to recognize and establish
relations with Israel. At Beirut, King Abdullah committed to be the first to normalize relations with Israel upon its
achievement of a mutually acceptable arrangement for coexistence with the Palestinians. He persuaded all other Arab
countries to promise they would do the same. To his great frustration, Israel did not respond. Since then, hope for a
two-state solution that could gain acceptance for Israel in the region has dimmed.
Many of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy challenges stem from recent American policies in the region. These policies have
had the effect of liberating Israel from all constraints on its settlement activities and belligerent intervention in its Arab
neighbors, installing Iran as the dominant political influence in both Iraq and Lebanon, consolidating rather than eroding
the Syrian-Iranian alliance, pushing Hamas into the arms of the Iranians, and raising regional tensions over Tehran's
nuclear program while doing nothing effective about it. Then there is Afghanistan, where the United States now seems
to be engaged in a crusade against militant Islam — one that many in the region now fear may soon extend to Yemen.
Saudi counter-terrorism specialists, who have a well-deserved international reputation for effectiveness, are convinced
that the most efficient way to radicalize Muslim populations and encourage terrorism against the United States and its
foreign policy partners is to invade, occupy, and humiliate them. They believe that the panicked militarism of the U.S.
response to 9/11 was exactly what groups like al Qa'ida hoped for. They see no sign that the United States is about to
abandon actions and policies that metastasize extremism and stimulate terrorist reprisal against Americans and our
foreign friends.

No longer willing to be publicly associated with U.S. policies in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere that
radicalize the region and menace the Kingdom's own security, Saudi Arabia is actively attempting to reduce its historic
dependence on America. To this end, it is building new relationships with countries like China, India, and Russia, while
strengthening cooperation with longstanding partners in Europe and Asia like Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and
south Korea. It is not that the Kingdom has given up on the United States. As the king's scholarship program for Saudi
students in this country evidences, Saudi Arabia continues to reach out and seek improved relations with America. But
Saudis no longer trust us to take their interests into account or to protect them from their enemies.
In December 2002, as the U.S. prepared to invade Iraq against the forcefully expressed advice of then Crown Prince
Abdullah, Saudi Aramco (the world's largest oil company) quietly abandoned a decades-old subsidy for the cost of
shipping oil to the North American market. Within months, China replaced the United States as the Kingdom's biggest
overseas market for oil. U.S. exports have remained relatively constant as the Saudi Arabian economy has boomed,
dramatically reducing our market share in our largest Middle Eastern market. Ironically, the best element of the US-
Saudi relationship is now cooperation against terrorists. This is a task in which the Saudis have perforce learned to excel.
American policies ensure an endless supply of angry young Muslim men in the region, including in Saudi Arabia.
The United States is now said to have entered a ""long war."" The last time we did so, in 1947 with Soviet Communism,
the enemy was obvious, George Kennan gave us a strategy, and skillful American diplomacy gave us the allies we needed
to pursue it. Kennan's ""long telegram"" from Moscow outlined a comprehensive approach to the political, economic,
cultural, and military containment of the threat to our survival and our values posed by the Soviet Union. We followed
his outline. Forty years later, as Kennan forecast, without our having to go to war with the USSR, our Soviet enemy
collapsed of its own infirmities.
This time, our ""long war"" is with various Islamic extremists, tribes, sects, and societies. We're not quite sure who our
enemy is. No Kennan has emerged to give us a strategy f6r winning without fighting or, indeed, any ""strategy"" at all.
instead, we are flailing about with our superbly lethal military in response to events. Lacking a strategy, we have been
unable to recruit foreign partners to support one. We are now alone in Iraq. We are isolated internationally on the
Israel-Palestine issue. Our NATO allies are with us in Afghanistan out of consideration for NATO, not because they think
we know what we are doing. Many of them have already announced their intention to withdraw. Pakistan is with us
only because all its alternatives are worse.
Saudi Arabia and America head al Qa'ida's enemies list. The Kingdom has, however, been successfully vilified in the eyes
of the American elite and public. To deal effectively with Islamic extremism, we need Muslim allies. There is none more
potent that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Yet we have made no effort to seek its advice about how to address the
challenges of Islamic extremism. We have not sought its help to legitimize an effective political, informational, cultural,
and economic strategy for productive engagement with the Islamic world.
Meanwhile, however, many things now happening in the Kingdom — like the implicit message of the king's vision for
KAUST — suggest that such a partnership with Saudi Arabia and Arab nations of like mind is possible. Such a partnership
could be the basis for a strategy to bring victory in this latest ""long war."" The common interests on which to forge an
alliance are clearly there. Last June in Cairo, President Obama brilliantly articulated a credible basis for sound relations
with the Islamic world. His vision was persuasive, but it remains a mirage, not a reality. It is past time to implement it.
An intensive effort to reset the relationship with Saudi Arabia and to craft a common antiterrorist strategy with its king
would be a good place to start.

Palestinian and Arab leaders. Erekat says the Palestinians ""have a major problem in not including east Jerusalem.""

as can be expected, huge amount of media reports and speculation, some accurate, some not

seized on by P's
i have gone over the same ground today as yesterday/last night, including emphasis on what our senior levels assess re:

she will likely hear about the significant difficulty the ""blunt"" explicit exclusion (vice a fuzzier approach) presents to

don't want to beat a dead horse, but don't want her to be surprised either

By JANET MASLIN
It is 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards's manager, a place that might look ordinary if
every wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world's most glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards has
a 3 o'clock appointment. ""Come on in, he'll be here in a minute,"" an assistant says — and here he comes in a minute, at
3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherd's pie
that Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones
don't play until another shepherd's pie shows up.
Chalk up the promptness to the man's new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is far
from the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself — very much
about himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote ""Ronnie,"" in which he described Brian Jones as ""me in a blond wig."" Bill
Wyman, the band's retired bass player and bean counter, wrote ""Stone Alone,"" in which not a 15-shilling demo disc went
unmentioned. Now Mr. Richards has written the keeper: ""Life,"" a big, fierce, game-changing account of the Stones' nearly
half-century-long adventure.
""It's the most difficult thing I've ever done,"" he says about the book. ""I'd rather make ro records.""
But he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl-
eyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. Today, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he is
positively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk of
steaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head:
both a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it.
""I've been through that phase,"" he says. ""Don't know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.""
He's been through quite a lot of phases. And they're all on the page in ""Life"": the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; the
lovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted older
one; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock
over the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os.) All of
this is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book's single biggest stunner is a
hand-written note on its jacket flap: ""Believe it or not, I haven't forgotten any of it.""
How, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as ""Satisfaction?"" ""I think my main
concern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,"" he says. ""Fox had to do a little sleuthing."" Fox is
James Fox, the journalist and author of ""White Mischief,"" who has been Mr. Richards's friend over many years and was
his collaborator in putting ""Life"" together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7
million.)
Mr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing
upon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. ""Spent day practising,"" the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in
January 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. ""Worthwhile, I hope!"" Also exhumed: a 1962 letter
from Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs off
""Luff/Keith XXXXX""
These artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste
runs to naval history and the novels of Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In any
case they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and ""Life"" began to click. Once his stories were told
and a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox read
B6
the whole book aloud. ""What I couldn't guess was that he'd be such a very good natural editor,"" Mr. Fox, reached by e-
mail, says of Mr. Richards. ""He cut, accordingly, for pace and rhythm — a real musical cut.""
As for calling the book ""Life,"" Mr. Richards did some editing there too. ""My Life"" was what the book was to be called. ""I
said 'I tell you what, just cut off the 'My,' and you've got a title,"" he says. He might just as appropriately have used another
title he likes, ""Keep It Dark."" But, he says, ""I'm saving it for a song.""
The contents of ""Life"" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was
persuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a
picture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? ""I really can't explain it,"" he says, deadpan, about that now.
""Maybe I've got an honest face.""
It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to
have done successfully 30 years ago. ""Stories like this aren't told very much,"" he insists. ""There aren't many people willing
to tell them.""
Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. ""My most spectacular one was in
Sacramento. ..."" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an
ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding
himself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, ""Well, they either wake up or they don't.""
""Life"" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book
that pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. ""Cold-blooded"" and ""vicious"" are only two of the
more printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an ""old gasbag."" Mick Taylor, the former
Rolling Stone, ""didn't do anything"" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (""Performance,"" starring
Mr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly
enough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.
Richards remembers replying with this: ""Later, pal.""
As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,
unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young
Jagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger's
contributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like ""Disco Boy.""
In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: ""It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'm
trying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,"" he says. And sure: ""There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it
all out, those things count for nothing."" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of
time. ""The important thing to me,"" he says, ""was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.""And
is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? ""No.""
But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As ""Life"" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is
yes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls ""Keefs Guitar
Workshop."" Here are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on
which they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for
""Street Fighting Man,"" ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and part of ""Gimme Shelter."" Here's how the silent beats in Elvis Presley's
""Heartbreak Hotel"" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards's most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that ""Heartbreak
Hotel"" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.
Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he is
surprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to
do so. What he finds most gratifying about having written ""Life"" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the
breadth and range of this book's material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, ""that what I hoped
was worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.""
It's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;
where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there's a discreet little skull in the middle of
the wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the items
likeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more
cigarettes in a pack.
""Do you mind if I smoke?"" he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certain
legal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasn't touched the
cigarettes. He hasn't even looked at them. He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted,
diabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry
white thing he's smoking.
""That?"" he says innocently when asked about the picture. ""Oh, that's just me lighting a cigarette. That's all I was doing.""","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773954 Date: 08/31/2015

The contents of ""Life"" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was
persuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a
picture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? ""I really can't explain it,"" he says, deadpan, about that now.
""Maybe I've got an honest face.""
It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to
have done successfully 30 years ago. ""Stories like this aren't told very much,"" he insists. ""There aren't many people willing
to tell them.""
Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. ""My most spectacular one was in
Sacramento. ..."" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an
ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding
himself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, ""Well, they either wake up or they don't.""
""Life"" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book
that pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. ""Cold-blooded"" and ""vicious"" are only two of the
more printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an ""old gasbag."" Mick Taylor, the former
Rolling Stone, ""didn't do anything"" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (""Performance,"" starring
Mr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly
enough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.
Richards remembers replying with this: ""Later, pal.""
As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,
unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young
Jagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger's
contributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like ""Disco Boy.""
In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: ""It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'm
trying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,"" he says. And sure: ""There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it
all out, those things count for nothing."" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of
time. ""The important thing to me,"" he says, ""was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.""And
is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? ""No.""
But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As ""Life"" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is
yes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls ""Keefs Guitar
Workshop."" Here are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on
which they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for
""Street Fighting Man,"" ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and part of ""Gimme Shelter."" Here's how the silent beats in Elvis Presley's
""Heartbreak Hotel"" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards's most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that ""Heartbreak
Hotel"" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.
Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he is
surprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to
do so. What he finds most gratifying about having written ""Life"" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the
breadth and range of this book's material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, ""that what I hoped
was worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.""
It's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;
where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there's a discreet little skull in the middle of
the wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the items
likeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more
cigarettes in a pack.

by Leslie H. Gelb
September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm
The president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the
fallout—and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.
Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the
closed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men were
helping The Washington Post's sleuth write ""the inside story"" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of
Herculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:
Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to ""tell their side of the
story."" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,
no one looks terribly heroic.
Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,
and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a
brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that
he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.
The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals
did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what
the generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after
they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The
military didn't provide him with that, either.
As they say in Missouri, ""Give me a break."" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what
he wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White
House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn't
understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's
wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the
strategy all by himself.
This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear
enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to
pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told
Woodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the ""classic"" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. ""I think about it
more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at
the end?"" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011
deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: ""I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole
Democratic Party."" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:
""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan."" So, if he wanted such a plan, he
should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.
Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.
And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom
well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up
their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,
victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,
Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not
a happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.
breakAd
The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over
naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and
perhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the
usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.
There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than
right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner
sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My
information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt
that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost
always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General
McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in
advance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as
much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified
U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,
that everything was ""conditions based."" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.
So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be
going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: ""You have to recognize
also that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been
enormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after
it. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."" The brilliant general said as much
to others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.
So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on
forever.
Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again, and I believe
him, despite his history of calling for ""victory"" and ""defeat"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book
demonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to
this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli leaders are criticizing former President Clinton's comment that Russian immigrants in Israel an
obstacle to peace. Clinton noted the most recent arrivals in Israel have the hardest time agreeing to share the land with
the Palestinians. He also said residents who have been in Israel the longest and have more of a historical perspective and
are most supportive of peace in Israel. Among the Israel leaders criticizing Clinton's comments is Foreign Minister
Lieberman, whose political party relies heavily on immigrant support. He called the remarks ""crude generalizations"" and
interference in Israel's internal affairs.

I'm sorry I was not able to join last week's meeting on Haiti but I have calls into Anne Marie and Arturo to get an update.
Once I get a better understanding of how we plan to move forward on a regional basis we will work on putting together
a comprehensive PD strategy to support our efforts.
If you like the idea I can begin to trial balloon it with media execs in US and LA that I know
personally to gauge their reaction.
Of course we can't rely on a psa campaign alone to sustain the effort so we will develop other PD strategies for
engagement throughout the region which I will forward as they evolve.
Let me know what you think. In the meantime I thought you might be interested in the report below (copy attached as
well) which outlines the results to date of our global media outreach initiative.

Successfully Engaging Global Media
About the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in Haiti
Examples of Post Efforts to Date
EUROPE
• Reinforcing the Secretary's message, U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directly with over 100 journalists in
an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlighted U.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with
France, the UN and the international community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee, MFA,
French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positive coordination with our French partners
and to set the record straight on the work of the USG in Haiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of
rising diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obama
administration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.
• Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S. commitment to Haiti at an
Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor James Earl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News
(audience 270 million worldwide) and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the 10 also spoke about Haiti on
January 20-22 on BBC TV 2's ""Daily Politics Show,"" BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, and other media and helped
embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV's previously negative reporting and reached out
personally to BBC producers to call attention to inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins
Sans Frontiers from delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.
• With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave an interview to Ta Nea
newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served in Haiti, was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper,
resulting in positive stories about U.S. assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia,
whose paper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti, and received a commitment to run an Embassy-
produced story to counteract the misinformation.
AFRICA
• Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly successful outreach programs based on
the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship, with African officers aboard, was headed to western Africa
under AFRICOM's African Partnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide relief
to Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistance to Haitians, PAOs at those
posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct live interviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in
excellent media placement in all four countries.
• On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview on Haiti with 5FM, a leading
youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. The Ambassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support
and congratulated South Africa for sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails
and SMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gips reached out to additional
audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded a program via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-
International TV's ""Rendezvous Africa"" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time
radio programs on two national stations.

• As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22, all major Angolan media gave positive
coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti, including Radio Nacional de Angola and the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an
editorial January 23 that stated: ""We need to believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics
of criticizing who is doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like this is not
acceptable... Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an idea and quickly come to the conclusion
that the possible failures and omissions do not supersede the positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking
the relief efforts in Haiti.""
EAST ASIA-PACIFIC
• The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on the editorial page of Seputar
Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, the Indonesian national news agency, and subsequently
appeared in most Indonesian media.
• South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti, PA Seoul arranged a Digital Video
Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who had previously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince
and was a fluent Korean speaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti as well
as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own active involvement in the relief work. The U.S.
Ambassador's blog on January 22, dedicated to the earthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in
three days, with almost all comments supporting U.S. concerns.
The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguid in Haiti on January 25 that
included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper, Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAMA
(Malaysian National News Agency), and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in
favorable stories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.
NEAR EAST
• Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated, with most of its funding coming from the Gulf and
Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic and mirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of
USG assistance in Haiti to Al-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minutes on
morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAO was able to address many of the
accusations carried in the Al-Manar report, including the myriad ""weapons testing"" myths being propagated by Russian
and Venezuelan media outlets. [Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was
designated as a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]
• Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L'Opinion published an op-ed entitled, ""Haiti: After
terror, the dread..."" The paper is generally considered to be fairly hostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat
and an FSN went to L'Opinion to discuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself,
accommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediately agreed that the piece had
been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himself by saying that public opinion had not quite
recovered from ""the Bush years,"" but readily acknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the
writer a dossier of Washington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which he promised
to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L'Opinion published an article entitled, ""The massive humanitarian
action of the United States,"" based on the articles provided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of
American assistance, both government and private sector, to aide Haiti's earthquake victims.
• Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has been largely negative and inaccurate,
portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examples include the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three
critical articles (1/21/01) under the headlines: ""US Crimes in Haiti,"" ""US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti,"" and ""US

Forces Stop Humanitarian Planes from Landing."" On 1/25/10, government-owned Tishreen published an op-ed claiming
that the superpowers were rushing towards a military conquest of Haiti in order to profit from reconstruction
operations, which is the new method of colonialism. On 1/28/10, DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador
Mustafa, who promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. To encourage more
balanced coverage, Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with journalists from government-owned and
independent Syrian media. Post also extended a personal invitation to an advisor of the Minister of Information.

Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying to
implement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We have
organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language
training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012
budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired
by senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report back
within 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward.

CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win. In
today's information age, politics is also about whose ""story"" wins.
National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other organizations
to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between the government and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773988 Date: 08/31/2015

protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles, or the recent
controversy between Google and China.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a ""paradox of plenty.""
When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell may, more than
ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.
For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British governments, has
paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: ""he rises at
dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.""
Skeptics who treat the term ""public diplomacy"" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple
propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign. Public
diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies.
The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or
stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension is daily
communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also
involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event, others will rush in to fill it.
The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political or
advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over weeks,
months, and even years.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years
or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels. These
programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial ""last three feet"" — face-to-
face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.
But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against
the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage
that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried to enhance its soft power by
successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet — and subsequent repression
in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.
Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not
always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy
undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy ""on steroids,"" staffed by diplomats trained in new media,
cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-represented groups.
The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to correct
daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message. The main strength
of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda. But its
weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings. The sender knows what
she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard.
Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer
relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to
accomplish, given their central accountability structures.
The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call ""the new
public diplomacy,"" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct governmental

contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building relationships with civil-society
actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad.
In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than
controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can
undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way
communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard
dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called ""smart power."" For example, the
current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and over-reliance on hard
power alone is not the path to success.
Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an
understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it degenerates into
propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead, it must remain a two-way
process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the minds of others.

Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu presents U.S. settlement plan to cabinet
JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a U.S. plan to his cabinet November 14
that would extend a freeze on West Bank settlements for 90 days in return for diplomatic and security incentives.
Washington wants Israel to renew a freeze on settlement building in efforts to resume peace talks with Palestinians,
who in September halted negotiations after just a few weeks when Israel refused to extend a 10-month settlement
freeze.
Under the U.S. proposal, if Israel extended the freeze Washington would pledge not to seek further extensions and to
veto any attempts at the United Nations to force a unilateral peace settlement.
U.S. security aid to Israel would also be upgraded.
""I will insist that in any proposal Israel's security needs will be addressed, both in the immediate term and regarding
the threats facing us in the coming decade,"" Netanyahu said in public comments before the cabinet meeting.
The prime minister has previously said any settlement moratorium will not apply to areas around East Jerusalem that
Israel captured during a 1967 war and the Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.
One official in Netanyahu's office said the proposal had ""positive elements"". Israeli political sources said a narrow
majority in Netanyahu's security cabinet, which is ultimately responsible, would likely support accepting the U.S.
proposal.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared the plan at a meeting in New York last week, Netanyahu said, adding that
U.S. and Israeli teams were still negotiating a final formula.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said there had been no official word regarding a renewed
Israeli freeze on housing starts in the occupied West Bank.
""An official Palestinian commitment will come only after President Abbas hears officially from the American
administration what is going on between them and the Israelis,"" Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
Palestinian officials in private have expressed anger over U.S. incentives to get Israel to prolong the partial freeze,
saying they were effectively bribing Israel to fulfill basic international obligations.
Israeli officials said Netanyahu, who faces a tough political sell within his own coalition on the settlement issue, had
pushed Clinton for the broad understandings.
Settler leaders, who said acceptance of the proposal would represent ""a fundamental collapse"" of the government's
integrity, called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue.
Under the U.S. plan, Israel would declare a further, three month suspension of construction in the West Bank, land it
captured in a 1967 war where Palestinians seek a state. Any building launched since the original moratorium ended late
in September would be frozen, a diplomatic source said.
Among the pledges offered to Israel by Washington was a guarantee to veto any resolutions brought to the United
Nations Security Council that seek ""to impose a political settlement on Israel,"" the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The United States would also undertake to veto resolutions deemed anti-Israel in the United Nations and other
international organisations, a move that could make Israel less vulnerable to threats made by some Palestinians to
declare statehood unilaterally in the event that peace talks fail.
The Obama Administration would also ask Congress to approve the supply of three billion dollars worth of advanced

The United States would further sign a more comprehensive deal to enhance its substantial security aid to Israel as
part of any agreement concluded with the Palestinians.

Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu presents U.S. settlement plan to cabinet
JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a U.S. plan to his cabinet November 14
that would extend a freeze on West Bank settlements for 90 days in return for diplomatic and security incentives.
Washington wants Israel to renew a freeze on settlement building in efforts to resume peace talks with Palestinians,
who in September halted negotiations after just a few weeks when Israel refused to extend a 10-month settlement
freeze.
Under the U.S. proposal, if Israel extended the freeze Washington would pledge not to seek further extensions and to
veto any attempts at the United Nations to force a unilateral peace settlement.
U.S. security aid to Israel would also be upgraded.
""I will insist that in any proposal Israel's security needs will be addressed, both in the immediate term and regarding
the threats facing us in the coming decade,"" Netanyahu said in public comments before the cabinet meeting.
The prime minister has previously said any settlement moratorium will not apply to areas around East Jerusalem that
Israel captured during a 1967 war and the Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.
One official in Netanyahu's office said the proposal had ""positive elements"". Israeli political sources said a narrow
majority in Netanyahu's security cabinet, which is ultimately responsible, would likely support accepting the U.S.
proposal.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared the plan at a meeting in New York last week, Netanyahu said, adding that
U.S. and Israeli teams were still negotiating a final formula.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahrnoud Abbas said there had been no official word regarding a renewed
Israeli freeze on housing starts in the occupied West Bank.
""An official Palestinian commitment will come only after President Abbas hears officially from the American
administration what is going on between them and the Israelis,"" Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
Palestinian officials in private have expressed anger over U.S. incentives to get Israel to prolong the partial freeze,
saying they were effectively bribing Israel to fulfill basic international obligations.
Israeli officials said Netanyahu, who faces a tough political sell within his own coalition on the settlement issue, had
pushed Clinton for the broad understandings.
Settler leaders, who said acceptance of the proposal would represent ""a fundamental collapse"" of the government's
integrity, called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue.
Under the U.S. plan, Israel would declare a further, three month suspension of construction in the West Bank, land it
captured in a 1967 war where Palestinians seek a state. Any building launched since the original moratorium ended late
in September would be frozen, a diplomatic source said.
Among the pledges offered to Israel by Washington was a guarantee to veto any resolutions brought to the United
Nations Security Council that seek ""to impose a political settlement on Israel,"" the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The United States would also undertake to veto resolutions deemed anti-Israel in the United Nations and other
international organisations, a move that could make Israel less vulnerable to threats made by some Palestinians to
declare statehood unilaterally in the event that peace talks fail.

The Obama Administration would also ask Congress to approve the supply of three billion dollars worth of advanced
warplanes to the Jewish state ""to maintain its qualitative edge"" in the region, the source added.
The United States would further sign a more comprehensive deal to enhance its substantial security aid to Israel as
part of any agreement concluded with the Palestinians.

Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying to
implement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We have
organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language
training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012
budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired
by senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report back
within 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward.
The New Public Diplomacy
Joseph S. Nye <http://www.project-syndicate.org/contributor/422>
2010-02-10
CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win. In
today's information age, politics is also about whose ""story"" wins.
National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other organizations
to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between the government and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015

protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles, or the recent
controversy between Google and China.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a ""paradox of plenty.""
When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell may, more than
ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.
For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British governments, has
paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: ""he rises at
dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.""
Skeptics who treat the term ""public diplomacy"" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple
propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign. Public
diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies.
The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or
stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension is daily
communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also
involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event, others will rush in to fill it.
The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political or
advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over weeks,
months, and even years.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years
or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels. These
programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial ""last three feet"" — face-to-
face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.
But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against
the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage
that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried to enhance its soft power by
successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet — and subsequent repression
in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.
Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not
always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy
undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy ""on steroids,"" staffed by diplomats trained in new media,
cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-represented groups.
The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to correct
daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message. The main strength
of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda. But its
weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings. The sender knows what
she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard.
Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer
relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to
accomplish, given their central accountability structures.
The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call ""the new
public diplomacy,"" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct governmental
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015
contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building relationships with civil-society
actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad.
In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than
controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can
undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way
communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard
dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called ""smart power."" For example, the
current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and over-reliance on hard
power alone is not the path to success.
Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an
understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it degenerates into
propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead, it must remain a two-way
process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the minds of others.

Gerry Adams to seek Louth nomination for General Election
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams has today announced his decision to put his name forward for the Sinn
Fein nomination for the Louth constituency at the next General Election. Mr. Adams was speaking today
at the Edentubber commemoration in County Louth. He said:
""Ireland is at a crossroads. This state is in the midst of a deep economic and social crisis. This
Government is probably the most unpopular in the history of the state. It is now implementing bad,
deeply damaging policies. It has no mandate whatsoever for this.
There is a better way. Together we can rebuild Ireland.

People need to make a stand against what is happening. We need a better way forward for our country
and its people.
All this imposes a huge responsibility on those of us in positions of political leadership. In the past I
have asked people to step forward and to show leadership.
I have asked people to make a stand. I believe that it is my duty at this critical time to step forward and
do what I have asked of others.
As Leader of Sinn Fein, I want to be part of the necessary fight-back against bad economic policies in
both parts of this island and for a fair, decent and united society for all the people of Ireland.
As a representative of west Belfast I should be able to do this in the Dail, but the Irish government
refuses to allow this, despite a commitment during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and
subsequently, by the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahem that he would introduce measures to allow speaking
rights for MPs from the north.
So, as Leader of the only all Ireland party with an all-island mandate I have a choice to make whether to
stay in west Belfast, a place that I love, or to seek a mandate in another constituency in the south. West
Belfast is my home. It is where Colette and our family are and where I live.
But after thoughtful consideration, and with the support of colleagues, I have decided to put my name
forward for Louth. If elected for this constituency I will work and stay here and travel home when
possible.
This means that I will be stepping down as an MLA for west Belfast. My replacement will be chosen
this week. I am proud and honoured to have represented the people of west Belfast in the Assembly. I
will remain as MP until the next Leinster House election.
This is a significant initiative by the Sinn'Fein leadership. It is a measure of our determination to provide
a real alternative to the consensus for cuts being pushed by the other parties.

Ireland needs political change. We need change in the Dail. We need more voices that will stand up
against the consensus for cuts – more voices that will stand up for ordinary people. We need new
politics. We need a political realignment.
A change of government without a change in policies will be worthless.
A Fine Gael led government, propped up by the Labour Party is not a real alternative.
Fine Gael and Labour offer nothing that is substantially different from the current government. They are
part of the consensus for cuts.
Sinn Fein is the only effective opposition in the Dail. We forced this government to hold the Donegal
South West by-election. We have shifted the debate on the economy by rejecting the consensus for cuts,
and producing a costed, viable economic programme that can protect the vulnerable and low and middle
income earners, while stimulating the economy and creating jobs.
This is a small island. The problems faced by citizens throughout the country are the same.
We have a republic only in name.
Sinn Fein is a republican party. We believe that a republic must first and foremost be about the welfare
of the community. This includes access to a decent public health service and the protection of vulnerable
people such as the old, the sick and those with disabilities.
It also includes at this time of crisis those who are economically vulnerable — including low and middle
income earners - a group that is growing in number by the day because of the bad policies pursued by
this Government.
As the leader of Sinn Fein, in this time of crisis in our country, I am making a stand with this initiative
— a stand for a better, fairer, united Ireland. I believe that things can be turned around. That there is a
better way.
Look at the progress that has been made in the north. The peace process has shown what is possible. The
North has been transformed for the better. Sinn Fein has led that transformation. We have demonstrated
what is possible when people work together in the common good, in the national interest, and for the
benefit of all.
Our focus at this time is on tackling the mistakes of this government and providing a real alternative to
the Fianna Fail lite policies of Fine Gael and Labour.

Whether it is charting a way out of conflict or striving to rebuild the economy, Sinn Fein is about
improving the quality of people's lives.
This must be the guide for the reconstruction of Ireland in the years ahead.
I intend to lead from the front.
The people of Ireland face enormous challenges at this time. But we are no mean people and I am
confident that with clear headed leadership and sound economic policies we can rebuild the economy
and return prosperity.
I want to pay tribute to Arthur Morgan who, for the past 8 years has been a first class representative for
the people of Louth and an outstanding member of Sinn Fein's Dail team.
I first met Arthur in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh where he was incarcerated for his republican beliefs.
I want to pay tribute to Marian. Without her Arthur could not have played the role that he has done over
the years.
He will continue to play an important role in Sinn Fein. His experience and talent will be available to
this party in Louth and nationally in the time ahead.

More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty January afternoon to witness the inauguration of
Barack Obama, who promised in his campaign to change Washington's mercenary culture of lobbyists, special interest
influence and backroom deals. But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting
down with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care
reform possible.
Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of
times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in
exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceutical
industry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push

health care system, but also supported key Democratic health reform policies

and providing Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program.

Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff
Rahm Emanuel <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/us/politics/16emanuel.html?_r=1> and deputy chief of staff Jim
Messina <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/20/AR2009022003853.html> . Emanuel
was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official, investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in
Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee
chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their unparalleled legislative abilities.
Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also
played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee
chairman Max Baucus <http://www.nytirnes.corn/2009/08/06/health/policy/06insure.html> . Baucus would be the
vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and PhRMA.
Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of
Congress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties
Tauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &
Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription
drug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare
would not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries
would not be allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and
would be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.
Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring
of 2008 simply titled ""Billy <http://www.youtube.corn/watch?v=NCROOg9CfAw> ."" It featured the candidate, sleeves
rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of Washington. ""The pharmaceutical industry wrote
into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug companies. And you know what, the
chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making $2
million a year."" The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, ""Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses
Washington lobbyist money,"" while the candidate continues his lecture, ""Imagine that. That's an example of the same
old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how to play the game better, I want to put an end to
the game playing.""
Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.
Over the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group spent over $28 million
<http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?Iname.Pharmaceuticak-Rsrch÷%26+Mfrs+of+America&year=2009>
on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48
outside lobbying firms. The total number of lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165
lobbyists representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens
were former congressional staffers including two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.
According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers contributed huge sums to congressional
campaign committees <http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=H04> during the same period--from
January to the end of October (4th quarter numbers are still being totaled), industry political action committees,
employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million. Those contributions tilted heavily to
Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any election cycle going back to 1990, the

first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that Democrats were so favored. Given
their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's intention to reform America's health care system, the new tilt
was perhaps not surprising.
***
On March 5, the White House held a meeting with major health care industry leaders
<http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health/jan-june09/healthcare_03-05.htmi> to try to bring them to the table
and see what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for
PhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen Ignani, Tom Donohue of the
Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House
meeting Tauzin appeared on CNBC
<http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/03/big_pharmas_top_lobbyist_said_what.php> touting health care reform and
promising to work closely with the Obama administration. In the interview he touted it as an ""optimistic plan"",
acknowledging that the industry did have a few problems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Some were
<http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/03/big_pharmas_top_lobbyist._said_what.php> caught dumb-founded
<http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjQxZjZhYTc0ZjM2MDAxMjQ1NDY4NzNhZWEzNjg3YmM=http://corner.nat
ionalreview.com/postPq=NjQxZjnYTc0ZjM2MDAxMiQ1NDV4NzNhZWEzNjg3YmM=> by this apparent change of heart
on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.
On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a
meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor
and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote
reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entirely funded by
PhRMA <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28362.html> . The two groups spent $24 million on their
advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod's
former firm <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26240.html> , AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.
In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least
four times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health
care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups pledged cost cutting measures
<http://cnnmoney.printthis.clickability.cornipt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Flealth+care+groups+propose+$2+trillion+in+cost+
controls±-+May.+11,+200984expire=-

htm&partnerlD=2200> to the White House that would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade.
President Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the
administration followed up with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Coming-Together-Bringing-Down-Costs/> .
The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v.
--n0KuoAV6ytO> in support of the health care reform process calling for the
government to finally ""fix"" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elements of the $2 trillion cost cutting
pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they could ultimately win out
and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House.
The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industry CEOs
met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available
schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee
chairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.
In a press release <http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2009press/prb062009.pdf> featuring a statement by Tauzin,
Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80 billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the
Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news reports
<http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BD18F267-18FE-70B2-A8F5960026D227DF> , Baucus initially proposed
$100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June 2 were able to win the lower
figure.
The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the ""donut hole"" in Medicare
prescription drug coverage. The ""donut hole"" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare
prescription drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
$2,700 spent and does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal,
50 percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the ""donut hole.""
In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we
can make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today."" This ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity also extended to the
pharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through
Medicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand
statement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the
White House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.
Baucus proceeded with a plan to convene a bipartisan group
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/us/politics/28baucus.html> in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White
House. These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike
Enzi and Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry -
which were reliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to
meet the White House's announced August recess deadline <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/21/obama-
defends-august-dead_n_241755.html> for passing health care reform.
Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with
Rahm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this
meeting). In August, The Huffington Post's <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/internal-memo-confirms-
bi_n_258285.html> Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that outlined the policies
that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug
negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D and Part B.
The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.
***
While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their
own versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the
final product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the
$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had
gotten the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation, Medicare
negotiating power and speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures
proposed by the committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80
billion cap agreed to by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.
The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the
CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public
with the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Angeles Times
<http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/04/nation/na-healthcare-pharma4> , in an exclusive report, featured quotes
from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and that, as Tauzin put it, ""The White
House blessed it."" Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, ""For his part, Tauzin said he had not only received the White
House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal
Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.""
The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, ""The president encouraged this approach ... He
wanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.""
Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijalva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/policy/06insure.html> , ""Are industry groups going to be the ones at the
table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?""
***
On September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed
$80 billion. Five days later, the New York Times <http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/drug-makers-plan-
to-back-baucus-plan-with-ad-dollarsh reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an advertising blitz
in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending ""...would be a follow-up to the deal that drug makers
struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House."" On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his legislation
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/16/health-care-bill-baucus-s_n_288218.html> to the public.
The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment
targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
Medicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to
push for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the ""donut hole"" completely.
Nelson claimed that his amendment would generate $106 billion in revenue
<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Nelson_PhRMA_amendment_fails.html> , or from PhRMA's perspective
increase their cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to
the pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted
with Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment
<http://www.washingtontimes.comfnews/2009/sep/24/panel-fails-overturn-white-house-deal-drugmakers/> . It is little
surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-
Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80 billion cap.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on
Dec. 3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan
introduced an amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal
Drug Administration (FDA) released a letter <http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/71307-fda-opposes-senate-drug-
importation-amendmen> objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: ""...as currently
written, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there
are significant safety concerns."" Dorgan's amendment was defeated
<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/1209/BREAKING_Senate_rejects_Dorgan_amendment.html> with numerous
Democrats previously in support of reimportation switching to ""no"" votes.
On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.
***
New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill
had been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted
Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the
senator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.
Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda,
particularly health care reform.
In the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air . After spending $100
million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the
pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut
by Tauzin, pushed Tauzin to resign his post <http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/health-reform-in-iimbo-
top-drug-lobbyist-quits0partner=rss&emc=rss> .
In an interview with Diane Sawyer
<http://www.politico.comilivepulse/0110/0bama_concedes_talks_raised_legitimate_concerns.html> , President
Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform, ""[T]he health care debate as it unfolded
legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongst supporters that we just don't know what's
going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back room deals.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel, in a move likely to increase trade tensions with China, approved a
bill that allows the United States to slap duties on goods from countries with fundamentally undervalued currencies.
The House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee backed the legislation on a voice vote, clearing the way
for the full House to take up the measure next week. It may never become law, however, as it faces an uncertain future
in the Senate.

TEL AVIV (AP) — A senior Israeli intelligence official says llamas has rockets with a range of 50 miles, putting the coastal
metropolis of Tel Aviv within range of its launchers. The official blames Egypt, saying it is not doing enough to stem
smuggling through a network of tunnels along the relatively short border between its Sinai desert and the Gaza
Strip. The official said most of the tunnels were concentrated in an area no longer than 2.5 miles. ""Egypt can stop all
this smuggling of weapons within 24 hours if they want to do it,"" the official said November 14, speaking on condition of
anonymity under Israeli security regulations. The official said, however, that intelligence cooperation with Egypt was
otherwise effective.

Erekat: PA to ask UN to recognize state soon
Chief negotiator says Palestinians will submit request as soon as Bosnia take over Security
Council presidency. 'Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't
witnessed before,' he says
The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian
state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan
News Agency Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take
the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.
""The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before,"" Erekat added. ""And
this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas.""
According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.
Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks.
The Palestinians have recently announced their plan to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Security Council
condemning Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
On Friday the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Erekat as saying ""the negotiations (with Israel) are over.
Now is the time for decisions, not negotiations.""

Chief Palestinian negotiator denies reports that he said PA would request the UN Security Council unilaterally recognize
Palestinian state along 1967 borders, says PA will instead demand criticism of settlements.
Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat on Wednesday denied saying that the Palestinian Authority plans to request that
the United Nations Security Council unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state along 1967 borders, Israel Radio reported.
Erekat said that the Palestinians have no intention of presenting such a proposal in the near future and that the earlier
report by Palestinian news agency Ma'an was erroneous.
He explained that the PA plans on demanding that the UN Security Council criticize settlement building in the West Bank.
According to the earlier report, Erekat had said that the PA plan to present a proposal to the UN Security Council on the
unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. He was also quoted as expressing hope that the US would not attempt to act
against the PA's attempts and also called for South Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a
Palestinian state.
The PA negotiator was speaking at a meeting of Palestinian security officials in the town of Jericho.
Erekat had added that PA President Mahmoud Abbas contacted international and Hamas officials in an effort to prevent
an Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip.
After Erekat denied the report, a senior official told Israel Radio that the negotiator's remarks prove that the Palestinians
are not interested in negotiations but are interested in forcing solutions.
The official said that the US will operate covertly to eliminate settlement criticism from the UN Security Council's agenda.
If they do not succeed, it may be possible to veto the proposal or to present a counter-proposal, the official added.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Palestinian efforts do little to promote peace.
""By choosing unilateralism over direct talks, the Palestinians are declaring that they renounce peace altogether,"" he said.
""The Palestinians are choosing not to renew negotiations and are doing all they can to score minor points. They are trying
everything except to talk.""

Replace Rahm
by Leslie H. Gelb
February 15, 2010 10:48pm
BS Top - Gelb Get Rid of Rahm <http://www.tdbimg.com/files/2010/02/15/img-bs-top---gelb-get-rid-of-
rahm_135707996825.jpg> Kristoffer Tripplaar / SIPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to
save his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid of National Security
adviser Jim Jones.
The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must
change key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly a
matter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven
records of getting things done in Washington and the world.
To be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or
his White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far
beyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except
for the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped.
So it is they who've got to go.
It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go.
One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—
and especially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints
is always the same:
• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not ""begrudge"" Wall
Streeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of
weeks ago that such big bonuses were ""shameful.""
• Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that ""I think it is absolutely
true that what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some
of these political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high."" He had to be totally
out of it not to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.
• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone
know how to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and
says he is ""an eternal optimist""—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any
common ground and believe the administration has to ""scrap the bill and start over.""
• It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a ""war of necessity"" and orders more than 30,000
new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see
some of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774051 Date: 08/31/2015
I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce
provided <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b6b4700a-10fb-lldf-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> a thunderclap on Washington's
negative consensus about the incompetence of Obama's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names in the White House,
and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story. They were said to fear the wrath of
the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially endorsed
<http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2010/02/core_chicago_teh the Luce finding and slapped his fellow
bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as it was during the Carter administration. There,
two very capable political campaigners—Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell—moved into critical White House positions
without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And they were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They
also added to the ""them"" versus ""us"" (Washington insiders and bureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia)
mentality that plagues most administrations.
The Chicagoans and others ""guarding"" the president create their own ""us versus them"" world. It's hard to imagine a
policy conversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has
Washington or policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge
the president on a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.
Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief
of staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills and
discipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and
the time to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the
University of North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House
chief as well under Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another
former Clinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.
Replace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to want
out anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a
position to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others with
proven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,
Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in
Washington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all
would help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and
policy head.
David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,
wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable
voice. Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom
Daschle, the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in
unofficial residence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and
Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role
in making policy.
Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearly
enough.
Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithy
Republicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions.
Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York
Times.
Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired
and respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by
wide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement
of this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise
plans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and
knows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.

Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the
National Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former
ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They
have it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama
on strategy.
Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all
possess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical
bonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or
three years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as
intellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in
sensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make
adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in
small as well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed.

Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran and Saudi
Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh,
targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to
negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's intelligence,
Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true,
perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions,
whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver
for Iran. Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always
remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This
approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and
tighten repression. Talking of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the
regime. The opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral
level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands
of political, killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in
reserve.

splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside
sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open
hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran. Its
refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are
enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is
therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign
sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking of
regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The
opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political
and moral level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might
involve thousands or tens of thousands of political killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out
that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have their own bomb. The Saudis
invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in reserve.

Former aide urges Obama to regain 'political narrative'
By Edward Luce in Washington
Published: February 15 2010
Barack Obama, US president, has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet in
order to regain it, says John Podesta, the man who headed the president's transition team.
""My friends in the White House would agree with this, that they lost the narrative,"" Mr Podesta said in an interview for
View from DC, the Financial Times' video series from Washington. ""Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: it
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774069 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774069 Date: 08/31/2015
needs, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... He's got a terrific
cabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.""
Mr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his first
two years, which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.
When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral
""massacre"" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November, he said: ""I subscribe to that view.""
Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was often
described as a ""government-in-exile"" during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had
three options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,
which would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a
election defeat in Massachusetts.
The second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support. The third would be to abandon the attempt,
as Mr Clinton did in 1993.
Mr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform
through. ""The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they're going to have to figure out which track is
viable,"" he said. ""It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.""
He painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. ""It sucks,"" he said. Pointing to a strategy of
obstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: ""I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but,
quite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.""
The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening
to turn the US into, ""in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule"", where the opposition automatically
opposes any serious initiatives.
The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of
Proposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. ""And so nothing gets done.""

Subject: 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria
When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew that Syrian society was growing increasingly young (population
will double in 17 years) and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential
harness for our purposes.
In what is the 1st of what I predict will be many interesting cases in the future, this past week a campaign went viral on
Facebook in Syria (even though Facebook is outlawed in Syria it is widely accessed through proxies) showing teachers in
Syria abusing their pupils. Thousands of Syrians made public their support on Facebook (the fact that people made their
identities known is notable) for the campaign to remove these teachers, and the Ministry of Education intervened and
fired the teachers.
This is the first known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria.
More will come.

HONOLULU (Reuters) - President Obama took the rare step on December 29 of temporarily appointing U.S. ambassadors
to Syria, Turkey and Azerbaijan, restoring a top U.S. envoy to Damascus after an absence of nearly six years.
The White House announced Obama would make ""recess appointments"" of Robert Stephen Ford as ambassador to
Syria, Francis ""Frank"" Ricciardone as ambassador to Turkey and Matthew Bryza as ambassador to Azerbaijan. Obama,
who is on holiday in Hawaii, also named Norman Eisen to be ambassador to the Czech Republic. Eisen had worked as an
assistant to Obama on ethics and government reform since the beginning of the president's term in January 2009.
A Senate source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the recess appointments for the three ambassadors were
likely to last for a year.

I thought your designation of Iran as a near military government was very good. Gary Sick has been arguing that it is in
fact a military government. Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the
challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an
ad hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring,
not publicly discussing, but thinking about.
On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the
Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort. Sumter and upon hearing of
Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun.
Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court
decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

Subject: H: FYI. The end of Justice Jim. Sid
Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political
activities in the 1950s and dabbling in the political campaign against Bill
Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.
A Faulkner County sheriff's office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was
found dead in his home about 10 a.m. Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted
chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical problems, he
said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.
He was 85. Here's a standard biographical history <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Johnson>
. This will end his prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some are
still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his name for his
Conway home, ""White Haven.""
Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction
with friend and political foe. But Mark Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about
men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an
effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at
curbing integration that was his brainchild. It had long been declared
unconstitutional by federal courts and was barely repealed by voters.

S.O.S. -- Showing Our Strength
The United States Congress did more these past few weeks than simply pass a tax cut and rid the military of don't ask,
don't tell. It showed the rest of the world that the United States can act decisively. In uncertain times, with multiple
countries seemingly intent on testing Washington's resolve, that may prove to be the lame-duck Congress' most
important contribution to America's future.
China is one case in point. In several recent meetings with Chinese officials and opinion leaders in Beijing and
Washington, it has been apparent that many see China as on the rise and America in decline. The economic crisis, our
recent raucous election culminating with the Democrats' loss of the House of Representatives, the emergence of the Tea
Party and the American public's loss of faith in institutions, have convinced many Chinese that both our economic and
political model have failed.
But passage of the tax bill; the reaffirmation of America's commitment to human rights with repeal of don't ask don't
tell; and approval of the START Treaty, a crucial national security objective, resoundingly demonstrate that our political
process works and that we are getting our own house in order.
The challenge for the incoming Congress in 2011 is to ensure that we stay on this 'can do' path, demonstrating that the
U.S. political and economic system is alive and well. Combined with our enduring military strength, China and others will
take notice, improving our ability to manage a range of international issues, from North Korea to Iran to climate change.
To ensure the world gets the message, President Obama and the Congress need to take swift action on:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774092 Date: 08/31/2015
Tax reform, deficit reduction and American competitiveness: The president is reviewing tax reform proposals and the
work of the several deficit commissions and study groups. Early in the next Congress, he should send to Capitol Hill a
comprehensive tax and deficit reduction package. Such reform is needed in its own right. But politically the president
must also demonstrate leadership by placing a set of proposals on the table and letting the new Republican-led House
grapple with it and take responsibility for walking their talk. This package should be part of a broader effort to promote
American competitiveness in the global economy through a fair exchange rate, a cut in the corporate tax rate, and
support for American manufacturing. A comprehensive initiative will also signal to those who doubt America's resolve
that we are serious about deficit reduction and modernizing our economy.
Energy and innovation initiatives: With Cancun having taken but a small step toward a global climate agreement, the
Congress should be challenged to do better. Even if 'cap and trade' has no immediate future, there are a host of
incentives and programmatic ideas that will increase energy research and development, spur innovation and move us
into a green, technologically sophisticated future. Our economic future depends on high-tech jobs, energy sufficiency
and nanotechnology.
Trade agreements: Passage of key trade agreements, beginning with the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement and
strengthened Colombia and Panama agreements, will signal that the U.S. is a robust import and export market and
reassert our presence in the march of globalization. No other country is idly waiting while the U.S. sorts through our own
politics. The European Union has finalized an agreement with Korea and is negotiating agreements with India and
Canada. We should, of course, only affirm free trade agreements that are in our interest, but Americans understandable
anxiety about loss of jobs cannot stall our progress when, in fact, some of the best jobs will be created by opening new
markets for our products.
Arms Control and Non-Proliferation: President Obama has laid out a vision for a nuclear free world that sets a
framework for American leadership. But dealing with Iran, North Korea and other would be nuclear weapons powers
requires all members of the U.N. Security Council. Indeed, the president should consider an arms control and non-
proliferation dialogue on a bilateral basis with all appropriate and key players, including China.
Immigration reform: Immigration reform, beginning with passage of the Dream Act, is critical for reaffirming America's
global leadership. A steady influx of immigrants has always been a source of wealth creation in the United States.
Although Americans understandably want to ensure security of our borders and a managed influx of immigrants, our
immigration policies hobble rather than enhance our economic future.
Young people brought to the U.S. by their parents deserve a pathway to good citizenship if they are willing to serve in
our military or get a college education that will serve America's objectives. How we treat immigrants says much about
our values, our openness, and our commitment to doing what is right, a set of values that we should emphasize and
celebrate.
Only by being all that America can be can we demonstrate to the rest of the world that America is not only not in
decline, but rather resilient and strong. Of course we should keep pressing others on the issues of key concern to us
including modernizing economies, resetting currencies, enforcing sanctions on Iran and North Korea, and doing their
part on climate change among other high priority issues. But America has always led by example on the global stage. The
Congress and the president took a lame duck session and showed that we weren't so lame after all. Now it's time for the
incoming Congress to do the same and show the world America's strength.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli court found former President Moshe Katsav guilty of rape on December 30,
media reports said, convictions of unprecedented gravity for a head of the Jewish state. Katsav, president from
2000 to 2007, had denied the charges of rape, molestation or harassment lodged by three ex-aides. He may now
try to contest the Tel Aviv District Court's verdict, and what could be a lengthy jail sentence, in the Supreme
Court.

MOSCOW (AP) - A judge sentenced jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky to 14 years in prison
following a trial seen as payback for his defiance of Vladimir Putin's power. Judge Viktor Danilkin handed
down the sentence after convicting Khodorkovsky of stealing oil from his own company and laundering the
proceeds. Khodorkovsky is in the final year of an eight-year prison sentence. His lawyers say the new sentence
is counted from his 2003 arrest and includes his previous term in jail.

Greetings Cheryl.
On reflection, I think this whole situation has become much more complicated than we had first thought, for me as well
as for the Secretary. I would really like to discuss it further with you, tomorrow if you are available. I will be in the BPC
office all day, although I have a conference call I cannot re-schedule between 12:30 and 1:30.
Main number over there is 202/204-2400. Or on cell at My B6

JERUSALEM (AP) - An Israeli lawmaker says Jewish settlers have hauled construction equipment into a settlement deep
inside the West Bank in preparation for the end of a construction moratorium. The end of the settlement slowdown
presents the first major crisis in Mideast peace talks launched early this month in Washington. Israeli Prime Minister
Netanyahu, who imposed the slowdown 10 months ago as a peace gesture, says he will not extend the restrictions. But
the Palestinians say they will not continue negotiations if building resumes. The U.S. is trying to broker a
compromise. Pro-settler lawmaker Danny Danon said on September 25 that activists plan to lay the cornerstone of a
new neighborhood in the Revava settlement September 26, the last day of the slowdown. He said further construction
is planned September 27.

Mike, I write to ask a personal favor. An old friend of mine named David Ramage died earlier this week
David was for many years the president of the New World Foundation. During that period the
Secretary served on the board of the foundation and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be
informed of David's death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a private
meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional details on the memorial service if
she were interested but the family's concern was only that she be informed. Mort

If this email is legit, it is something I never, ever thought I would see! I am in awe.
I don't know what motivated the robber here, but we are safely far behind in the masked robbery department. By my
quick research, former President Nixon masks lead the way (perhaps not surprisingly) with 11 reported instances,
followed by masks of the second President Bush (5 reported instances), and those of President Reagan (3). We appear
to be the first Democrat, however.
One other rational response to the Burton elevation occurs to me: strong alcoholic drink!
Have a wonderful new year!

Masked 'Hillary Clinton' robs Va. bank

A gun-toting man in a Halloween-style mask robbed a Sterling bank on Dec. 27, authorities said.
It appeared that the man wore a Hillary Clinton mask,

Shortly after 9 a.m., the man walked into the Wachovia bank in Community Plaza, approached a teller, brandished a
firearm, and demanded cash, according to Loudoun County sheriff's office reports.
The robber, who authorities described as a black male around 6 feet tall, then fled in an unknown direction with an
undisclosed amount of cash. He was seen wearing a black jacket with a red shirt underneath.
No injuries were reported, says Kraig Troxell, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, which distributed a
surveillance image from the robbery.
This robbery is not the first for the Wachovia bank in Sterling's Community Plaza this year. On Nov. 20, authorities said
the bank was robbed at gunpoint by Benjamin L. Sebastian

Just now the NYT is reporting what I assume you already know, that the US hikers held prisoner in Iran were grabbed in
Iraq. I also assume that you saw the report last June that they were seized by a Revolutionary Guard officer now held for
drug running and murder.
It seems that the hikers were too close to a drug trail. I will send you memos on latest political intel and policy ideas for

US Hikers Were Seized in Iraq
By Babak Sarfaraz
Posted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010
http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/
KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—
Since their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq
border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and
Sarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes
diplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian
authorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran
to conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the
three, along with the State Department, the Committee to
Protect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund
[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in
The Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying
charge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed
the border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-
publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in May, Iran has
released little information about the circumstances of their
arrest or the status of their case.
The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two
witnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and
Shourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not
in Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional
sources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who
likely ordered their detention has since been arrested on
charges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.
The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called
Zalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they
declined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian
forces, who have been known to conduct missions across the
border. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three
Americans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal
region, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies
in Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and
occasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,
although local residents are familiar with its boundaries.
The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out
of curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers
descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,
Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the
Iranian side using ""threatening"" and ""menacing"" gestures.
When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into
the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked
a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,
and apprehended them.
These witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made
on May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel
between the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times
reported, Bauer ""denied that they had walked into Iran, as
they were accused of doing, before stopping himself and
saying, 'We can't really talk about that.""
Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed
that the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a
cross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily
Telegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had
seen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the
Telegraph that the hikers ""were targeted and captured by a
group that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.
We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take
Americans hostage at this sensitive time.""
A State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware
of evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but
would not comment further.
Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to
the local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in
Marivan, a town close to the border in the province of
Kurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the
Americans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva
Taab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence
unit in the region. According to these sources — a former
member of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who
serves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab
would have had the authority to order the Americans'
detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the
Iranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the
Revolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining
national security throughout the Islamic Republic.
""When I heard the news that they had arrested American
hikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the
intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they
have people in this region,"" says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian
Kurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar
at Georgetown University. ""I thought they were most likely
lured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It
is consistent with Iran's past actions.""
Less than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself
was arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of
Mostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of
Marivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephew
was also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has
been implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a
profitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes
and kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,
numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against
Taab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and
murder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and he
awaits execution in a Tehran prison.
Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported on
Taab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in
January and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va
Kurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A
February 17 article describes Taab as the head of a ""criminal
band"" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were
under arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a
vast number of illegal killings.
Several sources describe Taab as the central power in
Kurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control
of the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in
particular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local
division had been commanded by Taab for about five years.
""At this point it's really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,
that are in charge, especially in the western provinces,
especially because the Americans are on the other side, in
Iraq,"" says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of
international studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert
who serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East
Report. ""On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in
charge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control
the borders.""
It is a region where, according to several Iran experts,
smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran
border is ""relatively porous because it's mountainous,"" says
Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,
which issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian
Kurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape
route for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates
and Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route
for goods. ""Smuggling is something that has taken place and
continues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of
humans across the border. It's something that happens quite
often.""
Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern
quadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the
black-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj
official and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who
had firsthand knowledge of Taab's activities, Taab's first
scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty
smugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods
across the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time
for Drunken Horses, which won the Camera d'Or at Cannes
in 2000).
The region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist
groups that have been demanding autonomy from the central
Tehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in
Kurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed
conflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist
organization by the United States and other governments.
Since 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,
has been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed
responsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards
soldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as
well as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military
helicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in
Western Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian
soldiers.
It has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants
enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis
Kucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether
the US government was ""fomenting opposition and
supporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups
and Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are
operating from Iraq."" Kucinich named two groups, including
PJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in
The New Yorker that ""Israel and the United States have also
been working together in support of a Kurdish resistance
group known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan,"" and that
a government consultant told him that the Israeli government
had provided ""equipment and training"" to PJAK.
The United States and Israel have denied any involvement
with PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained
substantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded
Taab's decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as
the repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In
early April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar
Moslehi told Iran's Press TV that ""it is quite obvious to us
that the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links
with Western and Israeli intelligence services.""
The Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish
militancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside
Iran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for
example, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked
several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June
4, officials in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged
that ""a small unit of Iranian soldiers,"" including a tank and
several other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into
Iraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.
Until his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran's counter-
offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that
several current members of the Guards told him that Taab's
stated goal was to ""completely wipe out PJAK"" in his
jurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at
Georgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border
assassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The
Kurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit
assassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008.
According to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,
Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,
when he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty
border smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally
shot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap
koolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish
civilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and
then kill them—claiming they'd died in a military clash—in
order to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his
superiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this
plot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been
apprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named
all seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,
identified as a ringleader.
PJAK has officially denied involvement in these border
clashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian
website Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a
former head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK
clashes may, in fact, have been ""bogus,"" said the Sanandaj
official. ""More or less no clashes with PJAK have been
reported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were
busted.""
A mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son's
disappearance. She said he went missing the same day in
early 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with
PJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border
town in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits
against Taab; she asked that her name and location not be
mentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.
Taab's scheme was wildly successful, according to the
Sanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taab's
name has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.
This macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when
Taab killed a local official's brother who was seeking work in
the area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the
cleric's son.
On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of
Iran's High Council for Human Rights, said that the
government's investigation was nearly complete and a trial
for Bauer, Fattal and Shourd ""should not be very far from
now."" In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the
hikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their
children. ""Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to
release them or move forward with a fair trial in which our
children can openly answer any allegations against them.""
""These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have
been victims of political machinations and manipulation,""
said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International
Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. ""The fact that they have
been held for so long without prosecution strongly supports
this trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime
and should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,
who has studied the judicial files against them, has
consistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal
entry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for
so long. With this new information, even that charge appears
fabricated, and there is no basis for holding them.""
As of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah
Shourd have been detained by Iran for ten months and
twenty-three days.

Iran Seized U.S. Hikers in Iraq, U.S. Report
Asserts
By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN
Iran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of
them in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when
the hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.
The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said
that the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were
close to the border but on the Iraqi side.
The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a
mountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his
friends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31.
A July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a ""female called him saying they were being
surrounded by armed men.""
At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army
division based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a ""kidnapping"" and said the three
American tourists ""were being taken to the Iranian border.""
The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained
— all on the Iraqi side of the border.
As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to
support the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft
was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces
were sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.
As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in
northern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens ""for being too close to the border."" The July report
reflects some frustration with the hikers for their ""lack of coordination"" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some
thoughts on the episode's broader implications.
""The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal
dissension,"" it notes. Read the Document >>","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774160 Date: 08/31/2015

Just now the NYT is reporting what I assume you already know, that the US hikers held prisoner in Iran were grabbed in
Iraq. I also assume that you saw the report last June that they were seized by a Revolutionary Guard officer now held for
drug running and murder.
It seems that the hikers were too close to a drug trail. I will send you memos on latest political intel and policy ideas for

US Hikers Were Seized in Iraq
By Babak Sarfaraz
Posted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010
http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/
KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—
Since their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq
border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and
Sarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes
diplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian
authorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran
to conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the
three, along with the State Department, the Committee to
Protect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund
[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in
The Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying
charge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed
the border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-
publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in May, Iran has
released little information about the circumstances of their
arrest or the status of their case.
The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two
witnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and
Shourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not
in Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional
sources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who
likely ordered their detention has since been arrested on
charges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.
The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called
Zalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they
declined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian
forces, who have been known to conduct missions across the
border. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three
Americans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774160 Date: 08/31/2015
region, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies
in Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and
occasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,
although local residents are familiar with its boundaries.
The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out
of curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers
descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,
Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the
Iranian side using ""threatening"" and ""menacing"" gestures.
When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into
the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked
a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,
and apprehended them.
These witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made
on May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel
between the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times
reported, Bauer ""denied that they had walked into Iran, as
they were accused of doing, before stopping himself and
saying, 'We can't really talk about that.""
Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed
that the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a
cross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily
Telegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had
seen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the
Telegraph that the hikers ""were targeted and captured by a
group that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.
We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take
Americans hostage at this sensitive time.""
A State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware
of evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but
would not comment further.
Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to
the local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in
Marivan, a town close to the border in the province of
Kurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the
Americans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva
Taab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence
unit in the region. According to these sources — a former
member of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who
serves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab
would have had the authority to order the Americans'
detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the
Iranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the
Revolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining
national security throughout the Islamic Republic.
""When I heard the news that they had arrested American
hikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the
intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they
have people in this region,"" says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian
Kurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar
at Georgetown University. ""I thought they were most likely

lured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It
is consistent with Iran's past actions.""
Less than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself
was arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of
Mostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of
Marivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephew
was also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has
been implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a
profitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes
and kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,
numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against
Taab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and
murder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and he
awaits execution in a Tehran prison.
Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported on
Taab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in
January and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va
Kurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A
February 17 article describes Taab as the head of a ""criminal
band"" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were
under arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a
vast number of illegal killings.
Several sources describe Taab as the central power in
Kurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control
of the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in
particular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local
division had been commanded by Taab for about five years.
""At this point it's really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,
that are in charge, especially in the western provinces,
especially because the Americans are on the other side, in
Iraq,"" says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of
international studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert
who serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East
Report. ""On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in
charge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control
the borders.""
It is a region where, according to several Iran experts,
smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran
border is ""relatively porous because it's mountainous,"" says
Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,
which issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian
Kurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape
route for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates
and Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route
for goods. ""Smuggling is something that has taken place and
continues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of
humans across the border. It's something that happens quite
often.""
Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern
quadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the
black-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj

book but more by Mandelson's endorsement coupled with his harsh statements about the left. This is something of a
regression.

Subject: Sudan withdraws from Darfur peace talks (AP)
DOHA (AP) - A Sudanese official said his government has withdrawn from peace talks with Darfur rebel
groups, but it is still committed to making peace. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir threatened to call off the
talks in Qatar and return negotiations to Sudan if agreement was not reached by December 30, and he carried
out his threat. Chief government negotiator Ghazi Salaheddine said the Sudanese delegation will leave for
Khartoum December 31. Ahmed Hussain Adam, a rebel spokesman, described the move as ""a declaration of
war"" in remarks to Al-Jazeera TV.

LONDON (AP) - Britain's opposition Labour Party elected Ed Miliband as its new leader on September 25 after a brother-
versus-brother battle to replace ex-prime minister Gordon Brown. Miliband, the 40-year-old ex-climate change
secretary, narrowly defeated his elder brother David Miliband, the 45-year-old former foreign secretary, in a ballot of
legislators, party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members. Three other candidates also competed in the
contest to replace Brown, who stepped down in May after Labour came in second in a national election and was
removed from office after 13 years by the Conservative Party-led coalition government.

I get these reports every morning. They are somewhat painful to read since, as you know, in Pakistan, the media can be
particularly outrageous. However, we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the most watched programming in
prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion in fairly provocative way and the guests,
who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can see, the first commentator is strongly anti US.
However, what I have observed since our media offensive began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest
as well, who will argue along the lines that it is only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better
job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things
we do. Also on occasion where there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy, the host will read a
statement from our Embassy in the following programming. We try to get airtime on these programs whenever
possible but it is hard. It 's a hard slog getting this right but we are making progress.

February 18, 2010
Program: ""Center Stage"" Express TV (02/18)
Host: Fahad Hussain
Participants: Munawwar Hassan (Ameer Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan); Shahid Amin (Analyst)
Topic: U.S. Agenda In The Region
Host: Pakistan has rendered countless sacrifices in the war against terrorism but it seems that the United States is not
ready to trust us. Washington's policy towards Islamabad is ambiguous. On the one hand, the U.S. has assigned Pakistan

the role of a frontline state in the war against terrorism while, on the other, it has signed nuclear deal with our worst
enemy, India. What, in your opinion, is the real U.S. agenda in our region?
Munawwar Hassan: The U.S. wants to make India the mini-superpower in this region. This American policy prompted the
Indian army chief to boast that his country can fight against China and Pakistan simultaneously. The U.S. needs our
cooperation against Iran and China. It also wants our help to occupy the resources of the Central Asian states. The
current wave of extremism in the region is the reaction of imperialistic policies of Washington. Despite our recognition
of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Pakistan treated their ambassador in Islamabad in a very humiliating manner.
In fact, our rulers have becomes the slaves of the United States. But Pakistan will get nothing by befriending the U.S. and
helping Americans in their conspiracies against our neighbors. The history tells us that Washington's enmity is
dangerous, and its friendship is fatal.
Shahid Amin: Every country devises its policies to safeguard its national interests and same is true for the United States.
However, it is the responsibility of our governments to protect Pakistan's interests while dealing with Americans. Today,
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda constitute the biggest threat to the U.S. security. But these terrorist organizations also pose a
potential threat to the security and integrity of Pakistan. Hence, like America, their elimination is also in our own
national interest.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Abbas vowed on September 25 to do everything possible to make
peace negotiations with Israel succeed and avoided any direct threats to break off the talks over settlements. In a
speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Abbas said the Palestinians would expend ""every sincere
effort"" to reach a peace agreement with Israel within a year. He did not refer to the Sunday expiration of an Israeli
freeze on new settlement construction in the West Bank. However, he made clear that Israel would have to cease all
settlement activities if the direct negotiations with Israel are to succeed. ""Israel must choose between peace and the
continuation of settlements,"" he said. Abbas has repeatedly threatened to break off the fragile negotiations with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the settlements.

Dana -
IME staff kicked ass tonight on New START. We arranged a press call for Gottemoeller with five Russian journos at 6:00
pm - and it went perfectly. Then two 1V interviews with Russian television from the mezzanine. BBC Russian radio to
top it. Thursday we're setting up a conference call for DC-based press (foreign and domestic) supplemented by reporters
from key countries in Europe such as Poland. (We're getting an assist on that from EUR and the Brussels Hub.)
We'll get Gottemoeller into the studio here tomorrow as well to do some clips that we'll push out on NewsMarket and
America.gov.
All told, a very nice foreign media package on very short notice - and on a very big ticket issue. My hat is off to Shai,
David, and Holly, and also to great collaboration from OBS and FPC.

Subject: Brazil's Lula decides against extraditing Italian (Reuters)
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Lula da Silva said he would not extradite former Italian guerrilla
Cesare Battisti, a move that could damage relations with Italy. Brazil's Supreme Court had ruled last year that
Battisti should be extradited on murder convictions from the 1970s in Italy, but it left the final decision to Lula.
The move, announced in a statement released by the Brazilian government, was widely expected and comes a
day after Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi warned that such a decision would be ""incomprehensible and
unacceptable."" Brazilian media reported any decision still had to be verified by the Supreme Court but it was
not immediately clear whether this was just a formality.

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights"" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,
particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all
Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services

Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015

To: Dad, Mom
Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin
There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights"" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,

particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding

around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet

started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all

Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic in their thinking at best and
arrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN - UNDP I
think - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political
rights"" - when they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting
that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts -though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security
volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly
women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.
They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they
wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important
than the first two `asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice
was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the
Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help
themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their
partners.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all
Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
■ Over next 6-12 months:
• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774218 Date: 08/31/2015

humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more

systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774218 Date: 08/31/2015
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all

Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
■ Over next 6-12 months:
• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people

out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.

Subject: Fw: [START and CTBT Lobbying] Graham: Two START 'stumblingblocks'stand in way of his vote - The Hill
I attended the Foreign Policy Initiative meeting this morning with Senator McCain as a speaker and he reiterated these
two stumbling blocks for New STARR 1. Modernization and 2. Missile defense. Sounded very much like talking points.
With missile defense he stated that ""he was very disturbed by the signing agreement with Russia"" that linked New
START with missile defense. He said he wanted to see a very strong statement that makes a clear distinction between
New START and missile defense. In terms of modernization he's taking his cues from Sen. Kyl who he thinks is making
good strides in agreements with the Administration. He said that he thinks both these issues can be resolved and the
Senate can vote on New START — he said that he thinks some Republicans are going to push that the senate only
consider and CR and the extension of the tax cuts.
He also said that he thinks it's a good idea to reduce nuclear weapons, but anyone who says that it will affect other
nation's (i.e. Iran and North Korea) nuclear ambitions are ridiculous. Someone asked if he supports President Obama's
vision of a nuclear weapons free world — he stated ""I hope that we have a world without nuclear weapons one day, but I
also hope pigs fly — and I think neither will happen very soon.""
He did mention that he is worried about the rise of the isolationist wing of the Republicans Party and the decline of the
internationalist wing. He stated that ""he was worried about the erosion of support within the Republican Party for the
Afghanistan War.""

Graham: Two START 'stumbling blocks' stand in way of his vote
By Bridget Johnson - 11/14/10 12:19 PM ET
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said if Jon Kyl takes care of those issues, he would vote for the arms treaty.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that he didn't know if the START treaty would come up for a vote in the lame-
duck session, but said two ""stumbling blocks"" had to be removed in order to get his vote.
Appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" Graham said he was ""very open-minded about the treaty,"" which needs 67 votes for
ratification in the Senate and would face an even greater hurdle with six fewer Democrats in the new Congress.
""You've got two impediments,"" Graham said. ""Modernization. Not only do we need a START Treaty; we need to
modernize our nuclear force, the weapons that are left, to make sure they continue to be a deterrent. And we need to
make sure that we can employ -- deploy missile defense systems that are apart from START.

""So you've got two stumbling blocks,"" he said.
Graham said those two issues would have to be dealt with, and in its current state he would not vote for the U.S.-Russia
arms reduction treaty.
""(Sen.) Jon Kyl is working with the administration to get better modernization to make sure that missile defense is not
connected to START,"" he said. ""If you could get those two things together, I would vote for the treaty.""
On CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Sen. John Cornyn said that he didn't think there would even be time to address
the treaty in the lame-duck session because the continuing resolution to keep the government operating and the
extension of the Bush-era tax cuts were more pressing.
""I don't think there's a lot of time,"" Cornyn said when asked whether there would be time for a ""Don't ask, don't tell""
vote. ""And I don't think there's a lot of appetite to try to jam stuff through. The president said he wants to pass a new
START treaty in a lame duck session. I just don't see that happening.""
President Obama assured Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Sunday that the lame-duck session will be used to
ratify the START nuclear-arms treaty.
""I reiterated my commitment to getting the START treaty done during the lame-duck session,"" Obama said at a photo
op, calling passage of the treaty a ""top priority"" of his administration.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who served under President Clinton, said on ""This Week"" that it was ""very
important"" that the treaty be ratified.
""First of all, it's a good treaty,"" Albright said. ""But part of the problem is we remember President Reagan said trust, but
verify. And what has happened is that the verification procedures have now not been in place for almost a year, so we
need that treaty for that.""
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.) said last week that he expects START to come up for
a vote in December.

48.
It says Thompson died early October 23. It was announced last month that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer.

absence from his post in July. Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stuart has been running the government in Thompson's

See bottom of message re the firsts.
These were innovations we pushed (particularly use of web for real time display of pledges and what initially was
described by those who did not like my idea as pay to play (or in this instance as I argued - it was pay to have a priority
speaking slot as those who did not have a pledge would get to speak, just not until the end).
Nice addition to our innovation and tech storyline.

Here are some of the ""firsts"" that you should be proud of (based at least on my experience in 8 major donors'
conferences so far):
First to gather written pledges from all donors
First to project individual pledges in real time at the conference
First to release individual pledges to the world public and media on the same day as the conference
In addition to these, the work that you put into scrubbing the pledges — with the rigor and integrity of development
professionals — ensured that the pledge figures were more meaningful and accurate than for most other pledging
conferences (another possible first).
All of these achievements are great in themselves, but they will be most important in their impact on ensuring that the
pledged assistance actually makes in to the people of Haiti. This is really just the beginning of that important effort, and
you will be playing a critical role in it — but you have set us off with the best possible starting point for that effort.
Thank you again. It has been and will remain for me a pleasure for me to work with you. Best regards, Roland
Please pass this on to others on the team that I have missed in this email.

Subject: (Reuters) Afghans say two students killed by NATO troops
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan officials accused NATO-led troops of killing two school boys in central Afghanistan on October
23 after a patrol came under fire by Taliban insurgents, but foreign troops said the circumstances were unclear.
A statement released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said two civilians had possibly
been killed in the Maidan Shahr district of Wardak province, west of Kabul, when insurgents attacked the patrol.
""During the attack, three Afghan citizens on a motorcycle entered the engagement area. Two of them fell off the
vehicle and were taken away by local villagers,"" ISAF said.
It said their condition could not be determined before they were taken away. The incident was under investigation,
ISAF said.
However, a spokesman for the Wardak governor said ISAF troops had fired indiscriminately and killed two students
about 30 miles west of Kabul when a rocket was fired at their convoy. He said the rocket was apparently fired by the
Taliban.
Wardak police chief Nawas Haqyar said ISAF troops were returning fire and mistakenly killed the students. The attack
prompted a brief demonstration by angry villagers, demanding an explanation from NATO forces over the killing.

FYI only--I saw Yo Yo Ma this week and we spoke about his Silk Road Project. Three members of his company are Iranian
and he is very interested in touring in and furthering cultural engagement with Iran once the country opens up. He asked
that I pass on this message to the Secretary, explaining that if and when this kind of engagement becomes possible, he
and the Silk Road Project are ready to embrace the opportunity. Ann

Subject: Reminder: WaPo Call re Bob Barnett
Gentle reminder about the Bob Barnett profile he emailed you about. Story is being written by David Montgomery of the
Washington Post, and is slated to run tomorrow - so we need to do this today, the earlier the better.
All you have to do is call into Ops when you're ready, they will connect you to the reporter (and add me in)
Here's the reporters description on the piece: ""...a large profile of Bob Barnett for the Style section. I know Barnett has
been a friend and counselor and campaign supporter over the years. I would like to ask Secretary Clinton her estimation
of what makes Barnett good at what he does, what he has meant to her in the various ways he has worked for her over
the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well
in his professional life for noted Republicans on book projects and other work. (A theme of the piece is how some say
Barnett harkens to a mythic time in Washington when players supposedly could more readily have relationships with
other side, even while sticking to principles in their political work)""
You have talked about Bob many times, but general points:

Subject: (AP) Iraqi PM on the defense in WikiLeaks release
BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq's prime minister is accusing WikiLeaks of releasing documents that detail prisoner abuse by Iraqi
security forces to sabotage his re-election hopes.
A statement released October 23 by Prime Minister Nouni al-Maliki's office said the timing of the documents' release
raises questions about whether it was motivated by politics.
The statement said the documents show no proof of any improper treatment of detainees while al-Maliki has been at
the helm of the Iraqi government.
It said he has taken a tough stance against terrorists but offered no details.

Judith,
Can't remember whether I forwarded this stuff to you.
As you can see, our staff feel that the Dialogue went pretty well in the press — and it continues to do well. The Foreign

U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue Media Summary
The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue dominated Pakistani media on March 24 and March 25. All major English and Urdu
language networks carried live the Secretary and Foreign Minister Qureshi's remarks at the opening session. On
Thursday morning, nearly all television networks led with coverage of the joint press availability. All major English and
Urdu language dailies featured the talks on their front pages, highlighting the Secretary's announcement of $125 million
in aid to Pakistan's energy sector. Reporting was straight-forward with favorable headlines: Dawn—""U.S, Pakistan
pledge to boost and broaden ties"" and ""U.S. to provide $125m for energy, power plants""; The News—""US vows to boost
energy, defence, trade ties""; Nawa-i-Waqt—""U.S. will neither abandon nor dictate to Pakistan""; The Nation—""New day'
for US, Pakistan: Hillary."" Media highlighted the positive shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, echoing Secretary Clinton's
statement that the talks are the beginning of a new chapter. Reports also focused on the question of nuclear
cooperation and U.S. engagement in the Kashmir dispute; however the U.S. position on these issues had been widely
reported by the media prior to the Dialogue. The Nation published an editorial, entitled ""Negative starting note,""
criticizing the talks before they began. The daily stated that ""promises will be made on some issues, including on nuclear
cooperation, which will not see fruition."" Other editorials stressed the need for a sustained commitment on both sides,
beyond March 24, to produce results: Dawn –""Prospects for Pak-US ties,"" and Daily Times—""Pak-US Strategic
Dialogue."" End Summary.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774566 Date: 08/31/2015
Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work
together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of
building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to
stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.

Just reached Tom about it. Alerted him to the version as it came to me, including potential of its breaking. He seemed
a) aware of the basis for what I'd heard, b) to share my assessment/concern (though asked me to elaborate, which I did
vividly), and c) prepared to make sure that whatever ready to be is said publicly - and whatever happens diplomatically -
put the kibosh on the version as it came to me.
Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you
and downbeat things about OMF. Said he wanted to discuss that with me in person. I said nothing of substance, except
always glad to talk.
Over and out, tho would appreciate you're confirming receipt, since I'm not cc'ing anyone on this.
Cha-cha-cha (even though you're not going to Argentina-and rightly so).

BRIDGETOWN (AP) - The Barbados government announced the death of Prime Minister David Thompson at the age of
48.
It says Thompson died early October 23. It was announced last month that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer.
Thompson, who has been prime minister of Barbados since January 2008, first became ill in March and took a leave of
absence from his post in July. Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stuart has been running the government in Thompson's
absence.

US civilians battle to help Afghanistan
By Matthew Green
Published: March 5 2010 22:43 I Last updated: March 5 2010 22:43
US State Department representative Christopher Harich (top left) and Kevin Melton flank Haji Abdul Jabar as they
discuss the restoration of a religious monument
Each morning this winter, Haji Abdul Jabar has packed a flask of home-brewed green tea for work. It's not frugality; he's
trying to avoid being poisoned. You can't be too careful: before leaving the house, he also straps a Smith & Wesson 9mm
handgun into a holster secreted in the depths of his robes. Seized with occasional fits of passion, Jabar has been known
to whip out the gun during meetings. He may be jumpy, but tactics like this are not entirely out of place in his line of
work: as district governor, the 65-year-old has an unenviable task — of wresting the Arghandab River Valley, one of the
most dangerous places in Afghanistan <http://www.ft.com/world/asiapacific/afghanistan>, from the Taliban.
Viewed from the roof of Jabar's district headquarters, the sweep of the valley is at once beautiful — bleakly majestic -
and charged with menace. A distant range of low, dun-coloured hills defines the valley's opposite flank. Orchards of
pomegranate trees, their branches stripped bare by the cold, line the banks of a river meandering across the valley floor,
dividing the east side of Arghandab from the west.
The district governor's office
The east is where Jabar's office is perched, and where US troops feel safer — it's the west side they call ""bad juju land"".
Insurgents use a strip of desert there to infiltrate Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban in the mid-1990s, and the pivot
on which previous Afghan wars have turned. Roadside bombs hidden in the lush vineyards last year turned Arghandab
into a killing field. A battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division deployed here in mid-December is hoping for better luck,
but a new showdown is coming. Stanley McChrystal <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/30b0c4d8-091f-11df-ba88-
00144feabdc0.html> , the Nato commander in Afghanistan, has vowed to secure Kandahar. The Taliban want it back.
One night, one of the insurgents called the governor's mobile. ""He said, `I'm going to kill you, you're working for the
Americans,"" says Jabar, sitting on the carpet in his office. ""I said, 'Do whatever you can do.' Then I abused him and hung
up."" Jabar normally cuts a rather solemn figure. At this -recollection, he laughed.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
Jabar is not alone in his mission. Aside from the 2-508 battalion of the 82nd Airborne, two Americans have arrived
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6f824828-183b-11df-9256-00144feab49a.html> in Arghandab to help out: 27-year-old
Kevin Melton and 35-year-old Christopher Harich. They're part of the Obama administration's ""civilian surge
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee3ee108-d60f-11de-b8Of-00144feabdc0.html> "", announced alongside a fresh build-up
of US troops.
Working out of the whitewashed, two-storey district office, this unlikely trio aims to turn the tide of opinion in the
district. They must do it before spring, when the valley will come into leaf and the Taliban fighters return from Pakistan
in time for the fighting season.
""Arghandab is the gate to Kandahar city,"" Jabar says. ""If Arghandab is lost, Kandahar is also lost. It's the most important
valley in Afghanistan.""
Haji Abdul Jabar and Kevin Melton of US Aid above the Arghandab Valley
Jabar, Harich and Melton have little in common but their beards. Melton, who grew up in the suburbs of Washington, is
working for USAid, the US government's development agency <http://www.usaid.gov/> . Hard-driving and -anxious to
get results, Melton juggles a raft of plans for projects from solar-powered lamps for villages, to schemes for
hydroelectricity and renovating a shrine clinging to a nearby mountainside. His past experience includes work in Sudan,
but the challenge in Arghandab trumps anything he has previously attempted. ""It feels like there's no end to the day,""
he said. ""It's physically, mentally, emotionally and intellectually exhausting.""
Harich is a lawyer and a former marine from Louisiana who until recently worked as a policy adviser to the governor of
West Virginia. He now represents the US State Department in Arghandab. ""I've no doubt in my mind that we're going to
have a fight this summer,"" he says. ""When the Taliban come back in May, are they welcomed with open arms?""
Strapping on their khaki-coloured helmets and flak jackets and donning wraparound protective sunglasses whenever
they leave the base, Melton and Harich bear a distinct resemblance to the US soldiers who protect them.
Jabar, meanwhile, sports neck and wrist pouches containing Koranic charms to ward off the health risks caused by his
high blood pressure. (He takes advantage of the medic in the US military base adjacent to his office for regular check-
ups.)
Both the Americans were lured by the challenge of participating in the US adventure in Afghanistan for a year. Sleeping
in vacant rooms in the district office and equipped with a V-Sat Internet link to keep in touch with superiors in Kandahar
city — but no shower — they must figure out how to work with Jabar to build local government more or less from scratch.
Harich aims to act as a ""mentor"", helping Jabar as he works with the -provincial government in Kandahar to assemble an
administrative team to govern the district of more than 55,000 people.
There are few tougher places than Arghandab, a valley where a procession of armies have been bloodied. First came the
British in the 19th -century, then the Russians in the 1980s, and then last year, the 1-17 -battalion of the 5th Stryker
Brigade lost 21 soldiers in five months of -fighting — one of the highest casualty rates any US unit has suffered in
Afghanistan since 2001.
Conscious of the rapid approach of the fighting season, Melton is drawing up plans for projects — such as rehabilitating
schools and clinics — that could quickly demonstrate to the locals the benefits of siding with the government of Hamid
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015

Karzai, Afghanistan's president. He works closely with army officers to ensure the military's own plans to implement
projects fit in with the wider, albeit still embryonic, attempts to bolster Jabar.
The trio's schemes can seem like pin-pricks set against the implacable valley below. So far, progress has been largely
confined to Jabar's office. Since arriving late last year, Melton and Harris have renovated the district centre, installing air
conditioners, curtains and carpets.
Jabar, who rarely ventured to his office from his home in Kandahar before these changes, now turns up almost every
day, driving the 30-minute commute in his battered white Toyota Corolla saloon with three police bodyguards,
-constantly wary of the risk of ambush. ""Getting the building is easy,"" says Harich. ""Getting a governor to come in and do
some work is a little harder.""
A trickle of men with beards and turbans arrive each morning and sit along the wall of the building waiting for Jabar to
arrive, shielding their eyes from the sun as it crests the crags. They come to apply for government identity cards or
attend a weekly council — or shura — to discuss projects planned by Melton. ""The fact that they're even discussing this
stuff is mind-boggling,"" he says. ""They're saying, 'I can come to somebody to do something. This is what government is
about: I can air my grievances to somebody other than the Taliban.'""
And yet Jabar is the first to admit that his writ does not run much -further than the building. ""I don't trust the people, so
I don't go out much,"" he says. ""They may try to shoot me.""
Vehicles out on night patrol
It can be tempting to measure progress in the west's war in Afghanistan in terms of damage to the Taliban — whether in
capturing the movement's leaders or driving back their fighters on the battlefield. Last month, headlines were
dominated by the arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4f14de4-1b09-11df-88fa-
00144feab49a.html> , the Taliban's second-in-command, and by the big Nato offensive in the town of Marjah
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c8d82998:1411-11df-8847-00144feab49a.html> . But even if more Mullah Baradars are
arrested, more military pushes launched, the Taliban may simply bide their time before once more exploiting alienation
from the corrupt or absent government. The only way to stop that is to undertake the painstaking work of stitching
together a government capable of providing more security and services than the ""shadow governments"" set up by the
insurgents.
Western countries have been talking for years, of course, about building governance in Afghanistan, but men such as
Melton and Harich represent a renewed commitment. US officials say more than 900 US civilian officers are active in
Afghanistan, compared with just 300 at the start of 2009, with more than 50 destined for Kandahar province. The hope
is that this team can deliver a one-two punch that long seemed elusive by exploiting military victories to nurture
functioning local government. ""We have to fix governance in some nominal way or this victory won't stick,"" says a senior
US official. But the sheer scale of the task in Arghandab alone reveals the enormity of the challenge.
One afternoon, Harich sat with the governor on the office carpet for a lunch of stone-baked bread and spinach. As they
talked, Jabar raised repeated requests: for bars of Dove soap, for boots for his bodyguards. The demands seemed
reasonable enough but Harich did not immediately acquiesce. Part of his job is using the Americans' ability to open and
close the aid taps to get Jabar to live up to their vision of an impartial, honest governor. But Jabar, like Afghan leaders at
all levels of government, relies on a patronage system in which his friends expect to be rewarded and where the barrier
between public and private money is porous.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
Like much of Afghanistan's political class, Jabar's ""legitimacy"" comes from his role as a Mujahideen fighter in the 1980s,
battling Soviet -invaders. (Arghandab witnessed heavy fighting: the Russians mounted a month-long siege but never
took the valley.) Although governors in Afghanistan's 34 provinces have the power — in theory — to nominate district
governors, US intelligence officers say Jabar owes his pre-eminence to the backing of Karimullah, the young leader of the
Alakozai, an ethnic Pashtun sub-tribe dominant in the valley.
Said Amir Mohammad Agha, whose refusal to recognise Jabar's authority keeps the valley divided
Divisions between clans mean that Jabar is by no means a consensus candidate. In particular, Said Amir Mohammad
Agha <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/54cf9eca-10e5-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> , the single-most influential man on
the west side of the river, resents him. US officers say Agha was once detained in Guantanamo Bay as a suspected
Taliban commander. As long as Agha refuses to recognise Jabar's authority, the valley will remain divided.
Even on the east side, to the frustration of Melton and Harich, Jabar has yet to prove he can garner much legitimacy.
Locals milling around his office mutter accusations that he skims off salaries for the few district officials who turn up to
work and steers US reconstruction contracts towards his friends. ""He's not a good man, he wants money and bribes,""
said one, reflecting comments from several visitors.
Jabar vigorously denies such allegations — indeed, they were linked to one pistol-waving incident in a meeting with the
Americans. Yet such behaviour would not be unusual in Afghanistan, where bribery lubricates the patronage-based
system that Karzai and past leaders have used to hold the ethnically diverse country together. The dilemma runs
through the entire project in Afghanistan. Western officials want to impose a template of efficient administration, but to
do this they have little choice but to work with leaders who rely on the traditional system to survive.
In Kandahar, the dilemma is acute. Afghanistan's centralised system means that Jabar is dependent on the provincial
government based in the city to send officers to fill his largely empty building, but only a few have materialised. Indeed,
Alakozai elders believe rivals from Karzai's Popalzai tribe are exploiting official positions in Kandahar to accumulate
political and economic influence at their expense.
There is a deeper tension. US officials often speak of putting an ""Afghan face"" on their work. They want to make it seem
as if local leaders are behind improvements to bolster their standing in the eyes of their people. Yet the talk of
appearances is a tacit recognition that the enterprise is, to some extent, founded on creating an illusion of an Afghan
government at work, in the hope that a real administration will rapidly follow. Can such an approach succeed? Assessing
this is hard when even venturing into the valley is a potentially life-threatening undertaking.
The risk of attack in Arghandab is so high that during a recent week in January, Melton and Harich barely ventured from
the base — apart from a brief trip in an armoured convoy to catch up with superiors in Kandahar city. Soldiers of the
82nd Airborne tend to get closer to the locals. Even a short trip out into the east side of the valley shows how close at
hand the Taliban are, and how hard it will be to persuade people that they are safe enough to side with Jabar.
The soldiers leave the base in high-wheeled armoured vehicles called Cougar M-Raps — designed to resist roadside
bombs. Lieutenant Ryan Christmas, a reassuringly experienced veteran of the 82nd, gives a briefing on where the convoy
should go if it gets hit by an IED. ""Call out what you see, gunners stay vigilant in what you're doing,"" he yells at his men,
-clustered around him before departure. ""If it looks wrong and smells wrong, it -probably is wrong.""

From the bullet-proof window, a procession of mud homes that seem to grow organically from the valley floor rolled
past. A few weeks before, a man had pulled out a pistol and shot and wounded two Afghan policemen near the road.
These days, insurgents are targeting foot patrols to make it more dangerous to try to build up a rapport with locals.
Sgt Donny Kuehner takes tea with Haji Jhapour
At a US outpost at a village called Sakari Bagh, Sergeant Donny -Kuehner, a 23-year-old from southern California, led a
patrol through a bazaar of ramshackle stalls selling blotchy bunches of bananas dangling from strings and stacked cans
of Power Stag — ""World's Finest Quality Motor Oil"". Removing his helmet, Kuehner entered a petrol station owned by
Haji Jhapour—the unofficial king of the bazaar whose assistant served green tea. An Afghan policeman wearing
mascara and a yellow bandana round his neck joined the circle as the two men talked, via an interpreter.
""How do people in the bazaar feel about us being here?"" Kuehner asked.
""The people in the bazaar are good people, they're busy doing business,"" Jhapour replied.
""You heard anything lately about any kind of Taliban anywhere, or anything?"" Kuehner asked.
""I'm so busy with my business, I don't have time to follow the Taliban — this is the job of the police,"" Jhapour said,
gesturing to the man with the mascara. ""When people come here and buy petrol I sometimes hear news. If I hear
anything, I'll let you know.""
As he walked back into the base, Kuehner confessed it was hard to know where local loyalties lay. Some of the labourers
busy filling barriers with earth to build up the outpost's defences had been beaten by Taliban fighters. ""The locals are
the key to all this,"" Kuehner said. ""Getting them on our side — if we could do that — it would be leaps and bounds from
where we are now.""
Such ambiguous encounters are the stuff of the daily grind of counter-insurgency, where building relationships is critical.
After gradually -adopting such an approach to fight the insurgency in Iraq, the US military is honing its skills in
Afghanistan. But it is clear that soldiers can only do so much: unless a viable government emerges, their presence will
have scant lasting impact. As the US faces the risk of increasingly messy conflicts in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle
East, building governance just after the fighting will be increasingly decisive.
Critics of the approach believe the US is being sucked into an open-ended ""nation-building"" exercise in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama has been careful to downplay such suggestions <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f6ce026-df6d-11de-98ca-
00144feab49a.html> , though in Arghandab, the -distinction is blurry.
Locals at work on a US combat outpost
On the mountainside near the governor's office, women climb winding steps to a shrine set high above the valley. They
whisper wishes into stones, wrap them in shimmering cloth and hang them from a pole planted in the tomb of the saint.

The site feels forlorn. Fountains cascading down the rocks have run dry. A restaurant with a panoramic view, film-set
staircases and ornamental trees lies abandoned. Turquoise tiles on the mausoleum dome are cracked.
Clad in their body armour, Melton and Harich take a tour with the -governor one afternoon. Melton wants to see the
restaurant reopen — if a new owner can be found. There is talk of installing a pump to make the fountains flow. In the
valley, a pair of US helicopters pirouette, scanning for insurgents. As the trio ambles about, an explosion sounds far off
on the valley floor. It sends up a puff of grey smoke. Talk of renovation jars with the reality that the fighting season will
soon resume — and the window to get anything done is closing fast.
There is one surprise. One morning, Agha, the retired Taliban commander from the west side, decided to pay a visit. An
enigmatic figure, he clutched prayer beads and produced a certificate from US forces saying he had been imprisoned for
four months in 2004 but no longer posed a threat. He seemed to want Jabar and his crowd to know this. Should he
decide to work with them, US officers hope for an easier year.
Perhaps the influx of troops and resources committed by Washington may encourage men like Agha to reconsider their
loyalties. But after 30 years of war, building institutions will be harder. Both the US civilians and military in Arghandab
were doing their best to help Jabar establish a -government. But all participants seemed conscious that even their best
efforts might not be enough. When Melton and Harich leave, there are no guarantees that Jabar will prosper.
In his waistcoat pocket, the governor keeps a tin of green chewing tobacco, a medallion for ""excellence"" given to him by
the soldiers of the ill-fated 1-17, and a hand-written letter from Afghanistan's intelligence service warning of a Taliban
death threat. ""Every day they are killing someone,"" he said. Then he climbed once more into his Toyota to brave the
road back to -Kandahar once more, taking his empty tea flask and his gun.

Hi Jake,
You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team to Brussels
for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had been receptive, but
now the bureaucrats are saying this would be ""counter-productive"", and instead prefer more regular videoconferences.
Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.

On the speech, it might be 15 but not much more. Dan K-P has taken over drafting
He has been incorporating fine-tuning edits today. I will email you a draft shortly, which will be tweaked
in the am. Unfortunately, there is no teleprompter at the UN.
On your book, I understand that Huma will bring it out in the morning.

Hillary Clinton gave a speech at the American Task Force on Palestine on October 20th. Her speech was the
best speech that any US Secretary of State has given on the Palestine question. What made her speech different
was her emphasis on two concepts that resonate with Arabs and Moslems mirroring justice and dignity. Her
speech was well received and several Arab commentators wrote positively about what she said.

Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:
The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.
The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.
The purpose of your teleconference would be to hear from the E3 and Ashton a status report on the EU's preparations
to impose such sanctions, and to discuss how the U.S. could best support the EU's forward progress. It would
supplement experts' level consultations we have been conducting for several weeks, including meetings on May 3 and
May 6.
The measures the Europeans are considering include bans on new Iranian bank branches in the EU, correspondent
banking relationships, new investment in the Iranian energy sector, and on access for Iranian ships to European ports.

Dear Cheryl:
I have been asked by the Turkish Embassy, who I represent, to request a meeting with Secretary Clinton for Mrs. Umit
Boyner, a prominent Turkish business woman. Such a meeting could be whenever and wherever you determine most
convenient for the Secretary -- either in Washington, DC or Turkey.
As you will see from the biographical information below, Mrs. Boyner has had a distinguished career as a
businesswoman, and she has also devoted time to philanthropy as well. Mrs. Boyner was recently selected to be the
chair person of the board of one of the most prominent Turkish business organizations, the Turkish Industrialists' and
Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD) — an organization comparable to the Business Roundtable. I have also attached a
document providing additional background information on TUSIAD.
Mrs. Umit is a great admirer of Secretary Clinton's and would be extremely honored to be able to meet with her. I know
the Secretary is extremely busy, but I hope she can find a window to meet with Mrs. Umit. Thanks for all you help and
my personal regards to Secretary Clinton.
Best;
Dick

Subject: (AP) Fate of Mideast talks in hands of polarizing rabbi
JERUSALEM (AP) - The future of the Mideast peace process could rest in the hands of one very undiplomatic man: an
outspoken 90-year-old rabbi who recently sparked an uproar by saying the Palestinian president should ""perish from the
world."" The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party is expected to hold the swing vote when Cabinet ministers decide on a U.S.
proposal to resume Mideast peace talks. The two Shas ministers participating in the decision are waiting for instructions
from the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. ""All decisions go through the rabbi,"" said Roi Lachmanovitch, a
spokesman for the Shas interior minister. The drama has once again turned the enigmatic rabbi, who has managed to
offend Arabs, secular Jews, Holocaust survivors, women and gays with fiery comments over the years, into the familiar
role of kingmaker. Politicians from outside his party, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are now lobbying for
his support. Officials in Netanyahu's office said his 15-member Security Cabinet - a group of senior government
ministers - remains closely divided, with the outcome of the vote hinging on the two Shas members. Amid the
uncertainty, Israeli officials said a planned vote for November 17 had been put on hold.

Administration should include education assistance in supplemental funding request for Haiti, Lugar says
Getting Haitian children back in classrooms should be a priority in U.S. assistance to Haiti, U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar said today
after attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony with President Barack Obama hosting Haitian President Rene
Preval. Earlier in the day, former President Bill Clinton also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that this should
be a priority.
""As the Administration prepares to present its supplemental appropriations request for Haiti, a top priority for recovery
and long term reconstruction efforts in Haiti should include significant assistance to get Haitian children quickly back
into the classroom,"" Lugar said. ""Assistance for infrastructure, technical assistance for instruction and curriculum
development especially should be included. Only with a strong education initiative will Haiti have a chance at a better
future.""
Lugar directed two staff members to accompany a Congressional Delegation to Haiti on Friday, March 5. During the visit,
staff saw firsthand the devastation experienced by Haitians and reported to Lugar that thousands of schools in and
around Port au Prince could remain closed for months or never reopen. As a result, Haitian children could be left
languishing in refugee camps. Before the January 12 earthquake approximately one-half of Haiti
<http://topics.nytimes.com/topinews/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo> 's school-
age children were enrolled in classes. Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti's population.
""The relationship between the United States and the Haitian government should be a consensual, cooperative
arrangement that preserves Haitian participation in decisions, while ensuring that the resources and expertise of the
United States Government and international community are brought to bear on the daily problems of Haiti. Education of
the Haiti's youth is an appropriate starting point,"" Lugar said.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6, or on the
next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian
poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal
Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine.
Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to
Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the
LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power.
The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright majority
in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by remaining as PM and
dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as ""Florida."" The Tories,
backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed
under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into
the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher,
screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile

Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.
Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.
I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.

Subject: The political ramifications of the Greek/European debt crisis
As you know, the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain, Portugal,
etc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices, most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt.
Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an
important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below.
As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to
brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.
This is long but worth it.
May 6, 2010, 6:11 amlt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence
France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English
and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention
and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a
principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary
Fund, is the co-author of ""13 Bankers.""The Greek ""rescue"" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented
and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by
the International Monetary Fund, are 'finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have
abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new
program calls for ""fiscal adjustments"" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio
peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest
enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,
has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by
2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could
be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that
Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the
economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by
another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely
optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward

Greece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece
needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end
of 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., with
G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5
percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-
G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit
of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an
""upside scenario.""The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,
roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign
debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay
the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their ""new normal.""
Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at
risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors
will run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published
recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank
runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a ""run,"" it is not clear where it
stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.
Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans
decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small
chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and
enormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a
debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;
leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek
""restructuring,"" because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks
pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It
all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and
at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under
pressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its
government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely
not hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would
produce:•
Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.•
As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term
financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt.
Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,
prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent
by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.
At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will
include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.
European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive
failure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives
have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the
ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a
reason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.

Sen Mitchell proposes putting out the following statement tomorrow. We would respond on specific commitments on
Ramat Shlomo if asked.
Special Envoy Mitchell left the Middle East on Sunday, where he completed the first round of proximity talks with Israeli
and Palestinian leaders. The talks were serious and wide-ranging.
Special Envoy Mitchell emphasized the importance of making progress in the proximity talks and of moving to direct
negotiations as soon as possible. We have received commitments from both sides, and we have made assurances to
both sides, that are enabling us to move forward. The full scope of these discussions will remain private.
As both parties know, if either side takes significant actions during the proximity talks that we judge would seriously
undermine trust, we will respond to hold them accountable and ensure that negotiations continue.
Special Envoy Mitchell will return to the region next week to continue indirect negotiations with the parties.

After further back and forth, we've come up with a way to mention Ramat Shlomo and incitement to violence that
should be acceptable to both sides. The additional paragraph would read:
We have urged the parties to help create an atmosphere that is conducive to successful talks, and they are responding,
including President Abbas' statement that he will work against incitement of any sort and Prime Minister Netanyahu's
statement that there will be no construction at the Ramat Shlomo project for two years. They are both trying to move

. Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters
against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems
quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has
also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged
background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a
less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).
What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National
Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the
LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its
terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh
pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for
strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has
wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.
Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party
man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming
to a leadership contest afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed

Miliband, David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed
has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that eventuality
Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London
Times polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more
than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.
What about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked this
morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new government.
(I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the
Tory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win outright,
failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft.
But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now,
do whatever deal can be done, maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a
new election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that
the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for
five years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament,
redistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.
What about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the only chance
for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously
lean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be
feckless and weak as they always have been.
So, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is deeply anti-
European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would cause havoc with peace
and economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it
is. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.

The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 9 May 2010
David Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron> 's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal
Democrats <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/Iiberaldemocrats> were dramatically undermined last night by the
leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/williamhague> planned to adopt in government.
The document, obtained by the Observer, is headed ""draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister"" and was
written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to
Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.
In the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message would be
that ""the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election"" to one firmly against any further integration.
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg>
and the Conservative leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal
justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government — demands many EU leaders
say they would resist.
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts: ""Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our aim is to
achieve these commitments during this parliament."" He would also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting ""we will never
join the euro"" and conclude: ""You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and
straight-talking.""

Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the
basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-
European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged
from Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.
Cameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-sharing
deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were ""constructive and amicable"". The 70-minute meeting
took place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as ""constructive and
amicable"".
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at
the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the
possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/oliverletwin> and George Osborne
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne> will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne
and David Laws.
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the
Conservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives>' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in
the past and will limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st
century.
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism
would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European,
but would not be drawn on the document.
Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg's demands by
watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory
government could not be ""held to ransom"" by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation.
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories, particularly on
economic issues.
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party's MPs,
issued a set of ""red lines"" which it said the party must not cross, including any measure that would increase the gap
between the rich and poor— ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any
suggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any
watering-down of the human rights act.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter-offer to the Lib Dems,
including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal
""coalition contract"" — as happens in Germany — that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the
Tory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact, though senior
government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option.
One re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour leader, claiming that the
party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.
""Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party
conference,"" he said. ""Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to
prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems.""

From The Economist print edition
Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to ""protect religion"" claim a small success
How dare you call us blasphemers?
IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and crucifixes in
Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the public square. But in both
those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the United Nations. Not over the outcome,
but over the slim margin of defeat.
On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its Western
members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the ""defamation of religion"" as an
infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (01C), which groups 56
mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of that kind through the General Assembly
and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest ever, and opponents think there could be a good
chance of defeating a ""defamation"" motion next time one comes around.

The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any sinister
intention (see article <http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15833035> ). And to

the reputation of a living person or entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no
longer, at least physically, alive on earth.)
But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the ""defamation"" idea is
worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise
dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay,
Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.
Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even higher. An ""ad
hoc committee"" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial discrimination. Certain states want
language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a new convention, or a protocol to the existing
one.
For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access
to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-
religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give heart to theocrats.
At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead.
But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would be better to enforce the
existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord will resume, with a new chairman, late
this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the
racism charter, because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva
spokesman for the International Humanist and Ethical Union.
Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the abuse of
blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make, for example, over
Pakistan.
Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's independent
Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has been handed down but
never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis, a group whose claim to be Muslim is
rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general
tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes (over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.
""The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with blasphemy,"" said All Dayan Hasan,
a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group. ""But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an
instrument of political and social coercion.""
When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's parliament is
revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling party to review the
blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime.)
On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five Ahmadis, a labourer
and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written ""Prophet Muhammad"" on the wall of a
mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed.
And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain. It seems that
his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and many Christians had to flee.

He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There
was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians (see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the
""defamation"" of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it.

I just wanted to make sure you know that the CARE speech is now going to focus on nutrition/health/early childhood,
rather than being a major health speech. I still feel that you need to do a health speech as a bookend to food and water
— perhaps before UNGA. You could focus on health in the context of the larger Millennium Dev Goals. You have not
given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there
will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous
amount of activity going on elsewhere in the world. And this is a legacy issue for you. (I have already relayed this idea to
CDM and Jake).

Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.
Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.
I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.

To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our
development message. It also tees up the health care speech you might give before UNGA. This is a speech that only
you could give and a number of constituencies will be delighted by it.
Hope this helps. I'm going through it now to make sure, it more clearly answers your question.
Thank you!

From Foster Care To Law School Graduate, Howard University Student Beats The Odds
Jelani Freeman lived in 6 foster homes in 10 years
Updated: Friday, 07 May 2010, 8:25 PM EDT Published : Friday, 07 May 2010, 7:55 PM EDT
By BETH PARKER/myfoxdc
WASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard
University Law School.
He remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster
homes in ten years.
""Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at?"" said
Freeman.
At 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of
kids in the foster care system - not much.
""All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well,"" said Freeman.
He beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.
""I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer
section that yells as you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across,"" said Freeman.
It will be different this time. When Freeman gets his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people
- friends and supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.
Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the
office of then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book ""It Takes A Village.""
Now, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know:
""There's a bright future out there for you if you stay focused and work hard.""

And to the adults who hear his story, Freeman said help a child. He is living proof of the difference it can make.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on November 17 he believes a new START treaty
with Russia will gain enough votes in the U.S. Senate to pass before the end of the year.
Gibbs said he believes an end-of-year session of the Senate will take up the arms control treaty and will be voted on
and ""we'll have the votes to pass it.""

mom's words, ""instead of feeling sorry for herself she takes the ball and runs with all the energy that she can summon in
the service of her country to the limit of her body ....and she dishes it out frankly without pussy footing around whether
to heads of State or media or major international conferences."" I felt VERY proud to be on your team. AM

BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010
One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met
with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,
none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of
being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and
basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.

As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.
""What are they saying?"" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. ""They are telling you to go back to your
country and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will
quite literally die if the Taliban return,"" she said.
In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus
whether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate ""reformed""
Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.
Carefully avoiding the word ""women,"" the general assured the questioning student that only ""moderate"" Taliban would
be eligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of ""moderate,"" which clearly depends on where
you sit: If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a ""moderate"" Taliban.
Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the
""moderate"" Taliban come back, but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no
security -- and until we've done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.
In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school
and of Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land.
A few months after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced
<http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/bush.speech.txt/> , ""The last time we met in this chamber, the
mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school.
Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government.""
The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They
strong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not
treated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped
a page from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea
<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038257?ie=UTF8&tag=fopo-
20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143038257> and facilitated new training and
educational opportunities for women.
But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues,
appears to be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any
sustained rhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in

Afghanistan. Since then, and especially since last year's Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have
all but disappeared. Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push
local shuras into including women in 2010? Forget it.
It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages
of the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats, human rights
abusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing
senior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.
In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their
suffering is real, as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Maternal mortality in Afghanistan
still makes the world's top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In
the countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the
first place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report
being beaten on a regular basis.
In July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report
<http://unama.unmissions.org/Portals/UNAMA/vaw-english.pdf> that represents the most stinging official
condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, ""The
current reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course
of seeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them."" Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --
before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated
soon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain
death <http://www.hrw.oreen/reports/2009/12/03/we-have-promises-world-O> while their murderers face 100
percent impunity.
For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender
equality was always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through
the deployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's
Affairs. Indeed, just before his recent ""election,"" Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive
measures designed to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.
Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai
successfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit, divorce, or have
guardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law
<http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/04/14/afghanistan-new-law-threatens-women-s-freedom> also legalizes forced
marriage and the rape of minors. It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the
power to prohibit women's access to work, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes
except for ""legitimate"" purposes. Even Karzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly
sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just wait until the Americans leave.
This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,
because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of
financial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.
Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said
<http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/03/138320.htm> in March, ""The subjugation of women is a threat to the
national security of the United States."" On a geopolitical level, Valerie's research has found that states with higher levels
of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better predictor of
bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie, along
with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of
Islamic suicide terrorism.

So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doing
more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan ""culture"" does not
allow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one
coalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: ""There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only
alienate them [Afghans]."" Of course, ""them"" here refers only to men.
But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan
women were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of
gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.
Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women
bravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans
assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.
Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,
despite increasing female recruitment and even ""female engagement teams,"" remains a bastion of masculinity, with
little sensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an
almost exclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no
comment from the Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.
And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only
damages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old
Afghan male pointed out, ""Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you
exploit women in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?"" Added another Afghan USAID
programmer working in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, ""It would be better for the coalition if
they could figure out a way to limit this kind of material.""
We can do better -- much better.
The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting
women's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.
The military should spend less time courting ""moderate"" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders
how gender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower
maternal and child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a
component in all governance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming ""peace jirga"" that will
include the Taliban. Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female:
yes, a full 50 percent.
Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women's
issues, noted <http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2009/125512.htm> last summer, speaking of female politicians in
Afghanistan, ""There is only one minister in the cabinet, and she is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the
civil service. There is only one female governor, in Bamiyan."" Obama must insist on important changes for women
before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan
government.
Better yet, the coalition needs to support ""regime change"" through the building of democratic institutions that will
groom a moderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the
Afghan population is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and
given a chance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs,
unable to marry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.
We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774862 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774862 Date: 08/31/2015
Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it has
committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality
enshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking
measures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory
group of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken
to implement the treaty's provisions.
Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate
and unique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as
active agents in peace and security.
Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of
the Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before.
To change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan
and the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an
existence not fit for animals.
We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off
(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should
have no faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality
and security, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to
the issue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks
<http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2009/125512.htm> concerning Afghanistan are the right ones: ""Progress in
Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political, and economic participation
of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights.""
American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women
can continue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break
faith with American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.

Hillary,
Sandy Weill called me Monday. He is eager to speak with you and asked that you give him a call.
He has spent time in recent weeks in the Middle East and has feedback for you on how people there feel, where they
want to go and how that affects the relationship between the US and countries in the Middle East. Sandy is not a
newcomer to the region and very much wants to share with you what he's hearing. He's a fan and wants to be helpful.
I promised him I would pass the message. His number is

Colleagues, the latest from Amb. Feinstein of Embassy Warsaw. In short, the crash took the lives of many of Poland's
senior civilian and military leadership; succession/transition will be the first major test of Poland's constitution. The
speaker of the lower house of parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski, will temporarily assume the presidency. The
constitution requires he call for presidential elections within 14 days and that elections take place within 60 days. An
unofficial manifest is included. Rgds, H.

All,
This is going out as a cable momentarily. The main point is that the.crash killed not only the President and his wife but a
broad swath of Poland's top national security leadership. In this sense it is an unprecedented governmental tragedy,
and a test of Poland's constitution. The sitrep follows.

Shortly before 1000 Warsaw time, a Polish government Tu-154 plane carrying a delegation headed by Polish President
Lech Kaczynski crashed in heavy fog at the airport in Smolensk, Russia. Russian officials have told the press that there
were no survivors; the foreign ministry spokesman said there were 88 passengers on board. The delegation was en
route to ceremonies hosted by the Russian government to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacres.
There is as yet not government confirmation of the deaths, but there is no expectation of survivors.
Speaker of the Polish Sejm (the lower house of parliament) Bronislaw Komorowski is en route to Warsaw to take over
the powers of the presidency and those of the Commander in Chief, according to press reports. According to the Polish
constitution, if the president dies in office, the Speaker temporarily assumes the presidency, and has 14 days to
announce the date of special presidential elections. The elections must be held within 60 days of his announcement.
This is the first major test of the Polish constitution, and the government is itself sorting out the details of the procedure
in this unprecedented circumstance.
Prime Minister Tusk is returning from Gdansk to Warsaw, and will chair a meeting of the Council of Ministers at 1P local
time. Tusk has received condolence telephone calls from Russian Prime Minister Putin, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, and other world leaders.
The magnitude of the loss is difficult to overstate including, in addition to the President and the First Lady, the top
national security leadership of the Presidential Chancellery, the head of Poland's armed forces, all or nearly all of
Poland's military chiefs, a deputy minister of defense, a deputy foreign minister, a presidential candidate, and members
of Parliament. Crowds of people with candles and flowers have started to assemble in front of the presidential palace in
downtown Warsaw. A mass in honor of those who died will be held later this afternoon. Poland is in shock and entering
a period of deep national mourning.
Below is an unofficial and incomplete manifest of those who are on the plane. Among them are:
President Lech Kaczynski
First Lady Maria Kaczynska
Former President Ryszard Kaczorowski
Wladislaw Stasiak, Chief of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland
Aleksander Szczyglo, State Secretary, Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland and Chief of the Office of
National Security

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforminglo international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.

Re: Hague meeting
On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a number of
issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)
1. Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public sector
spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles. Political stability depends
upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community policing, creating a vacuum that the Real
IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the public sector would make it difficult to increase private
sector investment. Does the new government understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the
situation?
2. Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek claficiation on
exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and over what schedule? How will
cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
3. Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats allows
the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have their way: marriage tax
allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear deterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran
on eliminating the Trident and erasing the UK nuclear deterrent. How will this actually work in practice?

4. Political Changes. The new government, because the coalition is fundamentally at odds with itself, has proposed to
pass a parliamentary bill that establishes a five year term for a government and furthermore establishes that a vote of
no confidence can only be passed on a 55 percent vote. You might just seek Hague's view on how this will work.

I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on Afghanistan now based at
was on his way back to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the
French Political Director. He had just spend three weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He
came across as patriotic, but deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French. •

OVERALL SITUATION
2. aid that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his last visit. The Taliban B6
were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses on them, but the scale was as nothing
compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of
engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling
weakness on NATO's part. In i e w , most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their
fellow travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more: they were in
a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back them, and was resisting US
attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the villages. did, however, acknowledge that he
had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been
expected. But the situation in Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would
continue for months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR
3. said repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had effectively penetrated,
an argely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were largely Barakzai, and working for either or both
of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law
was one of the largest drug traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city,
squeezing the Taliban back and out,F7said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of ""managing"" AWK: if the latter really
did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of his militias. In such situations, one
could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive
in Kandahar without the protection of his own criminal networks.77guess was that AWK would promise to be
good, but in reality stick to his old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban.
was dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar without
Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base, and, with his Canadian
nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. as also sceptical as to whether ISAF could ""shura"" its way to success in Kandahar. On the military side, he
thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city: for example, he thought the
Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it properly. The city of Kandahar would require some
10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be expected was a messy
stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an outcome that would not look at all like success.

r—,
■vondered whether ISAF really did need to go ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in iew, he was riding
for a fall. I said that I did not see how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to
generate positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6.F7said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all the other parties to
the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the Americans open such a dialogue with the
Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be
direct talks between the Americans and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had
little credibility left. Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan,
to get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first time in his
careerould see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate process, involving multiple
negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the high ground by
being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions about the withdrawal of foreign
forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year ploughing on with a
military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at worst. Then, with the 2011-12
Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull
US troops out more quickly than the situation merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making
preparations now for a messy political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been fraught with danger.
He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban could not be defeated or even properly
contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the
Obama Administration had understood that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to
think how he and other concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he
was considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an article would
have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what was an Afghan civil war) and
development and governance was no more than ""poetry"".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in negotiating direct with
the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more or less, in Washington and London, there
was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed -
first to get on the front foot militarily. It would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues,
such as women's rights and social restrictions. said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings
could be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a satisfactory
result.

11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary in his article in
The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 Phad missed the MIT speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK B6
election campaign meant that there was little that could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that
incoming or returning Ministers had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good
strategic discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our eyes
from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of harvesting political
success from military progress.

HRC,
Researched a lot since Tuesday. After Rochester water security meeting Simon came to my house last evening to discuss
subject issue, etc. Heck, greater good sometimes served in such small patio fashion. Re human trafficking, his software
can apply and previously uninvolved resources / relationships available. You know all this, but we didn't: Seems 'acta
non verba' needed. Despite increased pre-victimization education & awareness growing - and not-for-profits, TVP Act of
2008, your G/TIP office helping, appears same apps as tracking terror cells, interdiction of pirating and drug trafficking,
removal of financial lure not fully brought to bear. Forgive oversimplification, but akin to cessation of 400 years of
African / transatlantic slave trade..In addition to crushing backers' / sponsors' greed ( I guess so-called 'law' of economics
) blocking trader access, interdicting in progress, punishing / eliminating traders (sponsors & backers) would appear
to get it done. In addition to 21st century tech & resources, moral outrage should help eliminate / vastly reduce this
scourge. No doubt many good & smart people already involved, but perhaps the more the merrier. Simon ( and Dave's
former partner Jim Blom ) can bring nourishment to this table. Simon will get / remain in touch with Phil Goldberg - and
both of us with Kris. Thinking same apps could apply to Mexico. Talk about a destabilizing scourge too close for comfort !
We want to help. Great to see you & thanks again.

Peter Riddell
The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public
disenchantment with the campaign so far.
The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than
either a Tory or a Labour outright victory.
Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.
The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way, and these shifts are within the margin of error of the
average.
With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its
manifesto launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.
If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,
Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This
would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.
The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),
against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one..Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than
the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they
want Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.
The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past
week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a
week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.

The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely
honest about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about
cutting the deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the
extent to which they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.
Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing
the increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals
and the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign
workers employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).
In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making
the proposal.
In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign
workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc.
More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say ""none of the parties"", or ""don't know"", when
asked which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and
18 per cent Labour.
Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men and
middle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David
Cameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57
per cent) expect their leader to win.
Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not
sure that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to
the Tories.
Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13. Interviews were conducted across the

HRC,
As of April 21st Dave Stone's former business partner ( James F. Blom ), and I will establish 'Stone Harbour,LLC' (named
for Dave) in Delaware. This will be a nice merger of Dave's and my contacts. Apart from the ongoing vetting of Simon
Stringer's multi purpose software, at several levels, I am keen to help in the human trafficking effort. I have been in
touch with Sharyn Magarian (keeping Kris B informed) in seeking the status of that effort, as I am quite sure the combo
of Dave's former contacts and mine can help. Jim Blom has already spoken to several (Oracle Corp and his friends in
Silicon Valley) and they too are motivated. Work is work, but the human trafficking issue seems like the right thing to do.
All the best, Marty

Right now we have committed to talking further with the Cubans about reconstruction efforts and in further clarifying
the role they would play with HUEH. There are many areas we could work together with the Cubans that would be
beneficial to the Haitian medical system. You will still have the opportunity to call final package. We will make sure we
are clear where our proposal overlaps with the final vision of the Haitians and other donors.

Thank you for this and for coming — I am very grateful.
I have always understood that while GOH appreciated Cuban doctors and training
I understand that frame, and assuming they have physicians and
managers, it makes complete sense.
What I still feel like is a bit of a mystery to me, though I know once Dalberg has the proposed final strategy, they will do
a careful implementation plan at the direction of you and Judith, is what exactly this means for USG specific activities.

This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak, the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the, Cathedral and you had a
wonderful chat with him at the time. Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new
Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.
Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since
Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email
directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him
everything. He is aware of recent events.
I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.

Dear Melanne,
It has been awhile since we have been in touch. As you now we are under special pressure at the Ukrainian
Catholic University. It is a question of our welfare and future. But not only. Almost no educational institutions have
taken a stand in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under pressure. So is
business. The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of
government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the
freedom of the press and discourse.
Our students are scared.
Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-
student came to my office in a state of anxiety.
Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their
parents will loose their jobs.

There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our
finances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in 2004
before the election could be next.
The most effective defense is speaking out.
I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.
1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/32038200/Maariv-May27-10-Netanyahu-Says-He-Beat-Obama> and at bottom of post] In
the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel
between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make
concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said
Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to
expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the
administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,
and the Americans will ""make sure"" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take
""aggressive"" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the
settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. ""The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect,"" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. ""They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The
reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the
commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace
process in our region.""
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week
might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the
planned meeting as ""the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama
administration in the past number of weeks."" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave
crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that
was received as if Israel was ""no longer an absolute ally of the United States.""
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire
among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to
end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. ""The Democratic Party's coffers
are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to
continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,"" said one source in
Washington.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774925 Date: 08/31/2015
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two
months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture
taken together and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that ""Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap
once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very
difficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.""
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's
acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his
movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive
By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER
Published: April 18, 2010 •
WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White
House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress
toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.
Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.
James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to
develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be
considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.
Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not
sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.
One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,
described the document as ""a wake-up call."" But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months
they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.
In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: ""On Iran, we are doing
what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see
doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.""
But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran
choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it
needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.
In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a
""virtual"" nuclear weapons state.
According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain
Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774928 Date: 08/31/2015
obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely
possibility.
Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the
document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, ""The secretary believes the president and his national security
team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of
contingencies with respect to Iran.""
Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow
Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was
a line Iran would not be permitted to cross.
The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not ""acquire a nuclear capability,"" a step Tehran
could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. ""That includes the ability to have a breakout,"" he said,
using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its
technology to build a small arsenal.
Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a
difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. ""I'm not going to parse that right
now,"" he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,
as he said, ""became a self-professed nuclear state.""
Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps
toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" he said: ""If their policy is to go to
the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know
how you would verify that."" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, ""It's going slow -
slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.""
Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to
issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.
Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United
States was not adequately prepared.
He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic
engagement.
Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that
the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain
near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in
what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a
medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.
Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White
House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,
just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official
""chairman's guidance"" to his staff saying that while any military option would have ""limited results"" against Iran's
nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.
""Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,"" the admiral wrote.
Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under
way. So did General Jones. ""The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be

prepared for every possible contingency,"" he said in the interview. ""That is what we have done from day one, while
successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.""
At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's
most experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear
weapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.
The administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including
placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly

Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since

Dear Melanne,
it has been awhile since we have been in touch. As you now we are under special pressure at the Ukrainian
.Catholic University. it is a question of our welfare and future. But not only. Almost no educational institutions have
taken a stand in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under pressure. So is
business. The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of
government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the
freedom of the press and discourse.
Our students are scared.
Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-
student came to my office in a state of anxiety.
Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their
parents will loose their jobs.

I am headed back from China and I do not have S' email but I wanted to pass on this info regarding Father Charlie Beirne,
a friend to both of us and frmr Prez of LeMoyne College who is now at a hospice at Fordham University in the Bronx. He
greatly admires S and they always had a special relationship. We had planned for him to come down and have lunch w
us (incldg Mark Landler of the NYT who I have informed).
Charlie called me last night and he is stoic and brave but I think he would appreciate a call from S - who is simply admires
This is a Jesuit that showed his bravery by calling the Secy General of the Jesuits to ask to replace his Jesuit friend who
had been massacred (along w others) by the military at a University in Central America.

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,
I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his cancer has
reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He prefers to live out the
time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of his energy and other side effects
posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at
Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address below) or phone him on his cell phone at
Murray-Weigel Hall
515 E. Fordham Road
Bronx, NY 10458-5029
I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in his final
months with us.
Sincerely,
Fred P. Pestello, Ph.D.

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774936 Date: 08/31/2015
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann.
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could
almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a
pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,
but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in
many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that
opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to
improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development
director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a
large foundation, but it's a very focused foundation,"" she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to
726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects
of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and
diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals
with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens
Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to
healthcare for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating
statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School
of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places
of worship more welcoming.
""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have,"" said Kim
Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer
for the group since 2004.

Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that
people have been working on for years.
""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to
the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.
""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on
the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working
Order, a FISA grantee.
""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work
that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of
working with her.""
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order ""were of equal or greater
value to the organization than the grant funds.""
""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to
work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts.""
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A new frontier is helping
young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We have to keep the fire burning.""
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,
was promoted to executive director.
""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next
decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We know that we have found such a person in Kristy
Trautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the
board and the community.""

for a glass of champagne and a little jazz music!
I'd love to invite the Secretary. Is that even proper protocol? Although she probably couldn't attend, I'd like to share it
with her. Your thoughts?

Kurt:
You'll be happy to know that the Secretary's video message was the subject of a great op-ed in today's Thai Rath, the
leading newspaper in Thailand. They took exactly the line that we hoped they would — seeing her message not as the
U.S. intervening in politics, but, rather, as a very personal message from someone who cares deeply about Thailand. The
writer even referred to the Secretary's autobiography.
Thai Rath (leading Thai language daily), a commentary on Thai politics, April 16, referenced Secretary Clinton's video
statement calling for a peaceful solution to Thailand's political crisis: ""I would like to thank U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton for making a request herself and on behalf of President Obama for the two opposing parties to return to the
negotiating table so as to end their conflict. The short video message in which she mentioned Thailand was full of
sincerity. She started by saying that she was making this request as ""a long-standing friend of the Thai people"" She
referred to the Songkran festival which is the Thai New Year and said the opposing parties should consider this an
opportunity for a new round of talks. She emphasized that violence cannot bring happiness and peace and that the
opposing parties should talk in order to solve the problem. I believe Mrs. Clinton said this with sincerity. I have read a
book in which she wrote about her brief visit to Thailand as First Lady several years ago and showed her goodwill toward
the Thai people and Thailand in the book. During her most recent visit to Thailand last year, Mrs. Clinton gave an
interview and expressed her opinion about Thai politics in the most amicable way. Normally, I do not quite approve of
the U.S. because I think it often meddles with other countries' affairs. But I wholeheartedly agree with Secretary
Clinton's request and would like to sincerely thank her for it."" (To see the video, click here.

Subject: From the road
I wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and
respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna VV conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland VV conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.
The Dutch minister who came
said the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.
Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief
was palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many
of their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta' foundation has been very active
in advancing women's progress in Poland as well as working in other countries.

Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first
round voting, David was ahead. But when the votes of Ed Balls was distributed to
the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even
more a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of
the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had more labor union votes for leader, which
accounted for one-third of total. Ed's ""new generation"" rhetoric covers that
regression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new
decision, will be elected by the party. Ed is the former environment minister
and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective
yet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently
conceived, it should go without saying. David lost precisely because he held
responsible positions.

Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are
deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy. Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the
color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should
have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for
the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's
family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to
honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom
gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.

Kris,
Background All this separate from Simon's broader system(s) potential. Jim (James F.)Blom is Dave's former business
partner in Alacrity Homeland Group. Lives in San Francisco w/ wife and 2 kids. American, but well healed due to long
family history in Norwegian shipping companies. Grandfather was pals with Onassis. You get the picture. Has tight
linkage in supply chain & IT space(s). Deals in countries like you and I dealt with counties / states. Brilliant, resourceful.
Not prone to hyperbole, says he can bring the 'best in the world' to this effort Based on track record , I believe him. For
example, CdeBaca recently met with social networking folks in Silicon Valley. Not sure how that went, but Jim is close
friends with the guy who handles 'Facebook's' finances and said he can get his attention 'in one phone call'. Social
networking piece helpful, but probably a more aggressive 'identify, track, snag, deal with' traffickers required. Method(s)
& prioritization necessary. Let's look into. Spoke w/ Jim about CdeBaca connect. We're in. Best, Marty

Statement by the Secretary
Murders in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
Today the men and women of the Department of State are mourning the murder of three people connected to the
United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. One American consulate employee was killed along with her
husband, and the husband of a Mexican employee was also killed. I offer my deepest sympathies to the family, loved
ones and colleagues of these victims. The safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts
around the world is always our highest priority. I have spoken with our Ambassador in Mexico and we are working with
the Government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of
these horrendous acts are brought to justice.
These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting
many communities in Mexico. They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the
Government of President CalderOn to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico. This is a
responsibility we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture,
and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.

I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H

Hi Hillary,
I am back from the unpredictable and exciting elections in Britain.
Congratulations on all the good things you are doing at State.
You have so many fans from Manmohan Singh, who smiled broadly when we talked about you, to those women who
never stop dreaming.
I would love to catch up. I have to be in DC from the 12th-15th May, in case you have any time to sneak away for a few
minutes.
I understand it may not be possible, but thought I would check.
In any event, I remain your loyal adoring pal.

Here is a weekend factoid for you: among all living politicians in the United States who have ever held elected office,
Hillary Clinton the most popular.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775004 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775004 Date: 08/31/2015
That's right. Ever since she became Secretary of State, her favorables have soared into the mid-60's
<http://www.pollingreport.com/C2.htm#Hillary>, putting her well clear of any other statewide officeholder in the
country. The only national figures who are viewed as favorably as Clinton are Michelle Obama
<http://www.pollingreport.com/o.htm#Michelle>, Colin Powell <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Powell>, and
David Patraeus <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Petraeus>. However, they have never run for office, which
invariably lowers your favorables.
Hillary Clinton will turn 69 in in the final week of the 2016 campaign, which makes her slightly younger than Ronald
Reagan when he first was elected in 1980. Also, as Secretary of State, a major presidential candidate, a U.S. Senator,
and First Lady, she is also probably more credentialed than any other potential Presidential candidate, too. There is
even talk she may become the next Secretary of Defense <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/O51O/37672.html>,
further adding to her credentials.
Some have said that, in choosing Joe Biden as Vice-President, Barack Obama did not pick a successor to lead the
Democratic Party. However, that needs rethinking. Because Barack Obama made her Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton
remains remarkably well-positioned to run for President in 2016, even more so than she was in 2008.

Ma'am -- Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But the Belfast people have
come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.
Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government. called this
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.

Because our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to
finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to

John Rentoul: The party voted for David
Miliband but got the Panda instead
New Labour leader won't stand a chance against David
Cameron
The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The
party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacy
unchallenged.
Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party
members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.
If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and
panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which
he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the
third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had
direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to
ditch.
But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself
voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the ""New Labour Establishment"", in other words, the supposedly hated
Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in the
general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair's warning that
Labour lost because Gordon Brown ""moved a millimetre"" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that
Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the ""cork-popper"" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way
things have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,
lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.
Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggled
against Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775024 Date: 08/31/2015

Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the ""cork-popper"" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way

things have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,
lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.
Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggled
against Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.

Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government. called this B6
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.
Because our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to
finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to
have a copy in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from Cheers, B6

Subject: Mission Corrections: Bhutto Assassination
Under Secretary McHale:
This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a
noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an ""expert analyst"" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (151) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly ISI chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20
years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination — the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,
which is itself a remarkable document.
One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to her
security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.
Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting inciting and
unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached ""Correction,"" which will be seen by news editors
across the country.
Larry
Excerpt from the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:
179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf, identified three people she considered a
threat to her security: (i) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the assassination, (ii) General
(ret) Hamid Gul, a former Director General of the ISI, and (iii) Mr Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Chief Minister of Punjab until
22 November 2007.

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy.
Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be
seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people's lives influence everything from economic
development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our
elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and
health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts?

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy.
Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be
seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people's lives influence everything from economic
development to political stability and more..This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our
elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and
health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts?

Dear Cheryl—
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a ""great hero""
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called ""false positives"": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
""began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004."" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of ""false positives"" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case —the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
""acts of service."" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and ""political warfare"" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of ""what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it"" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as ""para-politics."" This
•
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Obama Backs Down on Sudan
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
JUBA, Sudan
Until he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on
Sudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.
Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western
monitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeply
flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying
they would be ""as free and as fair as possible."" The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried
reference this week to ""an essential step"" with ""serious irregularities.""
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against
humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was
quoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: ""Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against
our will.""
Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is
in his pocket, it's time to review your policy.
Perhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's a
reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues have
manifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism of
the government.
It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775058 Date: 08/31/2015

The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanese
government gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely.
The real game isn't, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-south
civil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided for
a referendum, scheduled to take place in January, in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They are
expected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.
Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of the
country's oil, and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.
""If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war,"" predicts Mudawi Ibrahim
Adam, one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America's willingness to turn a blind
eye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.
""They're very naïve in Washington,"" Mr. Mudawi said. ""They don't understand what is going on.""
On the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, the
nation's capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south will
muddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.
Here in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the north
attacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made her
way to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returned
for the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.
Ms. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 miles
northwest of Juba.
The trip ended by a thatch-roof but that belonged to her mother, who didn't know she was coming - so no one was
home. Ms. Wol was crushed.
Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flew
•into each other's arms.
To me, it felt like a peace dividend.
Yet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. ""I don't want
war,"" she said, ""but I don't think they will allow us to separate.""
My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reduce
the risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon.

Dear Cheryl—
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monsefior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a ""great hero""
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called ""false positives"": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
""began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004."" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of ""false positives"" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
""acts of service."" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and ""political warfare"" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of ""what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it"" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as ""para-politics."" This
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Dear Cheryl —
It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for him and
Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current status quo with Cuba
needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island needing space to voice their
views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.
It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help —

REVAVA (AP) - Dozens of Jewish settlers broke ground on a new daycare center deep inside the West Bank to celebrate
the end of the government's 10-month-old construction slowdown at midnight- symbolically renewing settlement
activity that threatens to derail peace talks with the Palestinians. Some 2000 people headed to another nearby
settlement for a larger rally, where activists released 2000 blue and white balloons- the colors of the Israeli flag- into the
air at sundown. The balloons were meant to symbolize the 2000 apartments that settlers say they are ready to be built
immediately. The festivities went ahead despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for the settlers to
show ""restraint"" as the curbs are lifted.

Can we put out the below?
Draft S Statement on the Hikers
I was pleased to learn of the consular visit yesterday by the Swiss Ambassador in Iran to the three detained American
hikers, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd. But we are disturbed by the families' reports of their children's
physical and emotional health. These three Americans -- innocent tourists in Iraq's Kurdistan region when they were
detained on July 31, 2009 -- have been unjustly held for almost nine months without formal charges or access to legal
representation. We ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to release these three Americans and allow them to go home and be
reunited with their families.

Lynn,
I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H

We of course understand and thank you for personally reaching out to us. It is a big loss for the weekend but as we
know it does not add up to a hill of beans. You are the best, and we remain your biggest fans.
Sweet dreams and Godspeed with everything you are doing.

Lynn,
I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H

After the flotilla attack, it's time for a new, kinder Israeli narrative
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, June 6, 2010
•Of the many confounding aspects of Monday's flotilla fiasco, one of the most curious is
the monotone quality of Israel's response. Within hours of the Israeli assault on an aid
ship bound for Gaza, while the dead and wounded were still being evacuated from the
scene, Israel's deputy foreign minister delivered a verbal broadside that became his
nation's public line: The flotilla organizers are terrorist sympathizers, they ambushed
Israeli forces, and they are responsible for what followed.
Even so adept a communicator as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, in a prepared
statement Wednesday that attacked Israel's critics as much as it defended Israel's
actions, could manage only one sentence of regret for civilian casualties.
Why, even to its friends, has Israel sounded so shrill, even tone deaf? Where are the
grief and sadness that Israelis ought to feel about a military operation gone awry? The
French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy expressed anger with the tendency of some
Israeli leaders to believe that ""they are alone in the world and will always be blamed,
and to act accordingly.""
Israel's friends know that the country has a case to make. But by hunkering down in self-
justification, Israel has confused that case. And now the jury of world public opinion,
comprising at least as many friends as foes, has stopped listening. At the United
Nations, speaker after speaker condemned Israel's action, and even the United States
joined in a harsh statement of condemnation. Normally pro-Israel editorial writers
added to the chorus of ostracism.
Israel has long seen itself as the Alamo, a fortress under siege. Decades ago, a song titled
""The Entire World is Against Us"" hit the Israeli pop charts. At the time, there was some
truth to the words: Arab states rejected Israel's existence. An Arab economic boycott
persuaded major companies in Europe and Asia to decline to do business in Israel.
Trade with many countries had to be conducted through third parties.
Indeed, Israel has faced recurring threats to its security and existence, a reality reflected
in a maxim I heard often during my time as U.S. ambassador there early this decade:
Israel goes to sleep with memories of the Holocaust and wakes up to the Arab-Israeli
conflict. In this context, the nation's military power was seen as a necessary response.
And in turn, Israel's narrative portrayed the country as a David facing an Arab Goliath.
Although the 1967 war changed this reality, Israel's narrative never really caught up.
Newly demonstrated military superiority and deepening ties with the United States
provided a measure of security the country had not enjoyed before. Egypt's President
Anwar Sadat was the first Arab leader to recognize this new strategic reality, and in
1979, he made peace with Israel.

But even as the outdated David vs. Goliath theme lingered in the minds of many Israelis,
among other segments of the population a new, religious-national narrative that
centered on settling and holding all of Eretz Israel was taking hold. Even though
settlements complicated Israel's relations with the Palestinians, and even though Israel
had evacuated the Sinai settlements to make peace with Egypt -- a move that vitiated the
argument that settlements were required for security -- activists such as Ariel Sharon
continued to argue that they enhanced security.
For a while, conditions allowed this new narrative to take root: The Palestine Liberation
Organization was busy attacking Israel from Jordan, Lebanon and the United Nations
and pursuing a tactical moderation designed to lull Israel into complacency.
But soon this reality, too, began to change. The PLO decided in 1988 to officially support
a two-state solution to the conflict and entered into dialogue with the United States. In
1991, Arab states participated in multilateral negotiations with Israel on water, the
environment, economic development and regional security. Arab and Israeli business
leaders met at international conferences. Israel's diplomatic isolation eased as China,
India and others established formal ties, and Israeli liaison offices opened in Morocco
and Arab states in the Persian Gulf. In 1994, Jordan made peace, removing the security
justification for Israeli settlements in the West Bank. And in 2002, Arab states
announced an ""Arab peace initiative"" offering peace and security in return for Israel's
withdrawal from lands taken in the 1967 war.
But the Palestinian intifada put a brake on these developments, ushering in a decade of
violence. As Palestinian terrorists attacked not only soldiers and settlers in the occupied
territories, but also civilians in Israeli cities, the Israeli storyline of the 19505 -- David vs.
Goliath -- revived.
I arrived in Israel as the U.S. ambassador in 2001, right after the first Palestinian suicide
bombing, and discussed these issues often with then-Prime Minister Sharon, usually in
the context of the choices Israel made in dealing with terrorism. Sharon believed that a
strong and unyielding military response was all that was needed to persuade
Palestinians to stop the intifada. A terrorist attack in Tel Aviv would often lead him to
impose a closure on Gaza, preventing the movement of people and goods.
A typical conversation with Sharon on this subject went something as follows: I would
suggest that the closure on Gaza would be seen by the media and even friendly
governments as collective punishment, would shift the media's story line from
Palestinian violence to Israel's reaction and could even drive Palestinians hurt by the
closure into the terrorist camp. Sharon would reply that his responsibility was to protect
Israelis, that the Gaza closure was designed to prevent further attacks and that the
media were to blame for distorting reality.
His underlying point was clear: Any impact on Israel's image and on the long-term
possibility of a widened conflict was outweighed by the need to prevent the next suicide
bombing. Whatever the consequences of its actions, Israel would not apologize for
defending itself.

Netanyahu would echo this refrain almost a decade later, after years marked not only by
the intifada but by an Israeli decision to build a security barrier. The decade saw a brutal
war in Lebanon in 2006, sparked by Hezbollah's kidnapping and killing of Israeli
soldiers and ended by Israel's destruction of Lebanese civilian infrastructure and
significant civilian casualties. The decade saw Hamas's election victory in 2oo6, its
violent takeover of Gaza in 2007, its unrelenting rocket attacks against Israel in 2008
and Israel's massive response, again involving great numbers of civilian casualties and
the destruction of infrastructure. By decade's end, a frustrated Israel had sealed off and
blockaded Gaza to try to stem the flow of arms to Hamas, but because of the worsening
humanitarian situation there, it was losing the battle for international legitimacy.
Narratives, as self-justifications, do little to explain the complexities, ironies and
paradoxes of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In the early198os, while I was assigned to the
American Embassy in Tel Aviv, I met a Palestinian nationalist figure in Gaza who was
unrelentingly opposed to the Israeli occupation. He shocked me one day when he said
he also admired Israel. After a near-fatal car accident in Gaza, his son had been
evacuated to one of Israel's leading hospitals, where doctors saved his life. My
Palestinian contact hated the Israel of the occupation, but he admired the Israel that was
blind to the nationality of a boy in need of care.
When an Israeli military plan goes awry and civilians are killed -- as happened last week
off the shores of Gaza -- should Israel's narrative take in the human dimension? Should
it express empathy for those affected by the conflict and by Israeli military actions?
Marla Braverman, an editor of Azure, an Israeli neoconservative journal, thinks not. In
the current issue, she writes that despite a longtime tendency toward self-effacement,
""Israel must learn to adopt a clear, unapologetic stance befitting a sovereign state.""
The fact is, however, that sovereign states make mistakes, and they apologize. Sovereign
states rely not only on military might and insistent rhetoric to defend their people, but
also on diplomacy and values of empathy and understanding. Sovereign states can be
strong while fostering a narrative of caring about the consequences of their policies.
In the aftermath of the flotilla fiasco, it is not just Israel's military tactics and its
blockade of Gaza that need a thorough reexamination. Its narrative does, too. A dose of
empathy might be a place to start. Israel will not break by military force and tough
rhetoric alone the political and moral double standards by which the world judges its
actions. But it can make its case better by tempering force with diplomacy, by caring as
much about the humanitarian distress among Palestinians as it does about
humanitarian causes elsewhere in the world, and by developing a storyline infused with
the moral and ethical standards by which Israelis judge their own behavior.

Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

(Jerusalem Post) - One policeman was injured in an altercation in Sheikh Jarrah, when police arrived on the scene of a
street fight and arrested four Arab residents.
After the arrest, other residents started throwing rocks at the police forces. One policeman was hit in the head with a
rock and was injured. He was treated on the scene. The police fired two warning shots into the air and the crowd
dispersed.
In a separate incident also on September 26, a molotov cocktail was thrown at police and border patrol forces on patrol
in the Givati parking lot near the entrance to Silwan and the City of David. The molotov cocktail exploded but there were
no injuries.
A sweep of the area by border patrol found three other molotov cocktails and three suspects were arrested.

You mentioned at Thursday's 8:45 meeting that you had talked to Qureshi and that he thought he was not going to get
any trade access to the EU. My EU contact writes that the Member States in the EU have been slowing up progress on
trade concessions to Pakistan, although the draft language negotiated w/ Pakistan still leaves room for the Commission
(which is pro-trade) to keep working on enhanced trade benefits for Pakistan. Still, the original timetable of 2011 will not
be kept. Even more ominous, any agreement will have to go to the European Parliament, which is down on Pakistan for
human rights reasons.

Subject: (Reuters) Sarkozy calls for October MidEast talks in Paris
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Sarkozy said he would ask Palestinian President Abbas, Israeli PM Netanyahu, and
Egyptian President Mubarak to peace talks in Paris before the end of October. Abbas said the construction of Jewish
settlements, subject of a moratorium that expired on September 26, should be frozen for another 3-4 months, a position
Sarkozy backed as crucial. ""The settlements must stop,"" the French president said.

Why Hillary Clinton was right about Colombia and Mexico
By recognizing the parallels between the two conflicts, the U.S. and Mexico can
learn valuable lessons from Colombia's battle with narco-insurgents.
By Thomas E. McNamara
7:27 AM PDT, September 20, 2010
Washington and Mexico City are unsure whether Mexico today resembles Colombia's
insurgency of 20 years ago. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton thinks it does; some
Mexicans and, maybe, President Obama think not (""The wrong solution in Mexico,"" Opinion,
Sept. 10). As the American ambassador in Colombia when the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar
was at riding high, and later when he was defeated, I side with Clinton in seeing many parallels.
The parallels begin with the Colombia of the Escobar days being a large, progressive democracy
with a vibrant economy. Colombia had a determined president and political leaders who
understood the terrible consequences of failing to take control of their own country. This
parallels Mexico today.
Colombia suppressed the cartel insurgencies with armed force and a political program. This
approach was, and is, largely supported by the Colombian people (witness the election victory of
President Juan Manuel Santos, who served as defense minister under predecessor Alvaro Uribe).
Cartel insurgencies no longer plague Colombia; only a reduced guerrilla insurgency continues.
New drug mafias still operate, but Colombian trafficking has been greatly reduced.
In both countries cartels demanded that they, not the government, determine the rules, settle
disputes and control police power. This is clearly insurgency: usurpation of sovereign power,
control of territory and the use of force to maintain control. What is unusual — and what causes
confusion — is that drug lords have a very limited political agenda.
Thus, in matters they don't care about, they don't interfere. The government can run the hospitals
and schools, set taxes, pay benefits, have elections, collect the garbage, put out fires and so on.
When the cartels' interests are involved, however, they insist that government must be
subservient to them on their territory — or deadly violence will result. This is quite different
from organized crime by American drug mafias. Our mafias do not attempt to usurp sovereign
power.
In one respect, Colombia is different. Besides mafias, there are narco-insurgents with full•
political agendas — the guerrillas. These are the usual, easily recognized types who proclaim
their agenda in revolutionary political statements, military structures and, above all, in their
insistence on sovereign control of all territory, not just territory needed for criminal activity.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775157 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775157 Date: 08/31/2015
What is surprising is Mexican denial of the obviously correct comparison with Colombia by
Clinton, which is why Obama tried to quiet this contretemps in Los Angeles last week. Rather
than object, Mexicans should acknowledge parallels, study the many mistakes and successes of
Colombia over the last 20 years and learn from them. Mexicans, Colombians and Americans are
partners in the struggle against narco-insurgency, whether of the unusual or the usual kind.
As Colombia learned, so Mexico and Central America will also: Retaking lost sovereign control
is violent. Americans must understand that these battles are to regain government control.
Reducing trafficking comes later. Mexico's mafias will not disappear, but they can be forced to
abandon insurgency.
The U.S. properly supports our neighbors by giving them political, military and law enforcement
assistance, as our drug consumption is one cause of the insurgencies — as is drug production
south of our border. We cannot just move out of our neighborhood, so we have an interest in
cleaning it up. These insurgencies corrupt us, just as they corrupt others.
While we have been a good partner overall, we have failed to control arms smuggling south
across the border. Make no mistake: We armed Escobar and the Colombian drug insurgents 20
years ago; we still arm the guerrillas. We also arm the Villarreal Barragan and Beltran Leyva
cartels in Mexico. Our pitiful border controls are a national disgrace and a major cause of the
blood spilled in Mexico and Colombia.
What we need today is not for Mexico to claim its situation is far different from the Colombians',
or Americans thinking this is only a Mexican or a Colombian drug problem. We need all three to
recognize that we are partners in a common struggle for legitimate governments to fully control
their territories and borders and suppress insurgency by all legitimate means. The three partners
are getting there, but none is there yet.
Thomas E. McNamara was ambassador to Colombia from 1989 to 1991. He served as a State
Department official in the Clinton administration and both Bush administrations.

Haiti recovery blueprint includes foreign donors
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
jcharles@MiamiHerald.com
Call it the $100 million club.
That's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in Haiti's early recovery under a plan Haitian
President Rene Preval plans to present at an international donors conference in New York at month's end.
While Haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the Jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude earthquake -
- $11.5 billion -- Preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the development plan that will
shape Haiti's reconstruction over the next decade.
""It moves it in the right direction,"" Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the Washington D.C.-based International
Crisis Group, said of the plan, which he has seen. ""I've said, the first phase of reconstruction is a decade. The real test is
a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of Haiti, it will continue for that time period.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775183 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775183 Date: 08/31/2015
The plan includes creation of an Interim Haitian Recovery Commission that will -- for the first time -- seek to guide how
and where aid is spent by giving both Haitians and foreigners a vote in reconstruction priorities and projects over the
next 18 months. Haiti's president will retain veto power and there's a starring role for former U.S. President Bill Clinton if
he wants it.
The blueprint is certain to come under plenty of scrutiny in Haiti, a country plagued and in-fighting among donors. Over
the years, billions of dollars in aid -- often delivered after hurricanes or political coups -- has failed to produce any signs
of lasting progress in a country that remains the poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
Clinton, who is to visit Haiti Monday along with former President George W. Bush, will be asked to help lead Haiti's
reconstruction planning over the short-term as co-chair -- along with the Haitian prime minister -- of the commission,
several sources confirmed to The Miami Herald.
Clinton, who is already in charge of the international relief effort for the United Nations, has not said whether he'll
accept the job as Haiti's reconstruction czar but he has championed the strategy, saying the goal is to provide to Haitians
the success that has long eluded them.He and Bush are visiting Haiti, where more than 200,000 people were killed in the
quake, in their roles as co-chairs of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. The private U.S. fundraising effort, initiated by President
Obama, has raised more than $36 million.
The commission's goal will be to plan and coordinate reconstruction priorities and projects over the next 18 months with
recommendations from a 20-member board made up of Haitians and foreign donors. Eventually, the commission would
morph into the Haiti Development Authority (HDA), a central planning agency tasked with approving all reconstruction
projects in Haiti regardless of which country or aid agency is funding it.
The authority's executive director, like that of the commission, likely would be a well-respected Haitian.
""Haitians must have the chance to lead the rebuilding of Haiti,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chief of staff
Cheryl Mills, a key person in talks. ""Development authorities have helped other countries that have large donor
communities to accomplish their visions -- we want no less for Haiti and its citizens.""
The original plan, first reported by The Herald last month, was modeled on the successful reconstruction authority
created in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami and presented by Mills to Preval and top Haitian officials last month. Other
countries and multilateral institutions also presented plans to the Haitian government.
The U.S. plan has since undergone several revisions at Prevails urging.
Among them: offering a voting seat on the commission's board to each donor pledging $100 million or more over the
next two years and donors who provide $200 million in debt cancellation. As a result, Venezuela is among the likely
donors to help review and approve projects. Initially 16 members, the board was expanded to give a say-so to Haiti's
private sector and labor unions and the 15-nation sub-regional Caribbean Community (CARCIOM). The plan also
establishes a Multi-donor Trust Fund, administered by the World Bank, to possibly pool donors' dollars for
reconstruction projects.
For decades, Haiti has been plagued by a lack of planning and coordination among donor nations and aid groups as they
battled among each other in the poverty-stricken country.
Using the Indonesian model employed in Indonesia after the Asian tsunami, plan supporters say the reconstruction
commission offers Haiti the best chance to lead its own redevelopment and to change the way donors do business,
ending an era where aid groups spend budgets larger than Haitian ministries without any accountability to the Haitian
people. But that can only be achieved in Haiti, say supporters, if donors and their projects are coordinated, and in line
with Haiti's vision and post-disaster reconstruction needs, which will be presented at the March 31 New York conference

and remains a work in progress while the government seeks input from various Haitian groups, including the Diaspora.
Also Haiti's parliament must vote on the creation of the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission.
Still, the idea of putting Haiti's reconstruction into the hands of one central authority -- or having some donors channel
their money into a trust fund -- is not without detractors. Some argue that the authority could render government
ministries obsolete because projects would now bypass them, while others point out that a similar World Bank fund in
the Sudan has been troubled by rules leaving schools and healthcare facilities undone as hundreds of millions of dollars
remain unspent.
Meanwhile, Haitian government officials worry that donors may not want to change the way they do business with Haiti,
rendering the reconstruction a failure before it gets started.
""The creation of the [trust fund] or the [Haiti Development Authority] are improvements to changing the paradigm if
and only if everybody plays the game -- putting most of their money in the fund -- and access to the funds is more
flexible than the usual process of disbursing from the international donors,"" Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive
told The Herald.
In the past, donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to assist Haiti but have fallen short in disbursing those
dollars -- or at times spent the money on projects without consulting the Haitian government about whether the
projects were needed.
Last week, as representatives of the Haitian government and others met to prepare for the New York conference,
Bellerive warned that ""New York could be a failure if we don't reach an agreement on the structure for the coordination
and the organization of the trust fund...(and) don't manage to establish together the priorities for immediate
investments,"" to begin reconstructing the country.

GAZA (Reuters) - An Israeli air strike in the central Gaza Strip September 27 killed three gunmen belonging to the Islamic
Jihad group, Palestinian medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said a group of militants preparing to fire a rocket
at Israel had been targeted, and that the air strike caused an explosion and a secondary blast. Ambulance workers and
medical officials said they had recovered three bodies from the site of an explosion that occurred after darkness fell
outside Bureij refugee camp, near the Israel-Gaza frontier. Hamas television reports said the blast had been caused
either by an Israeli air strike or cross-border tank fire.

By Marc Grossman
Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human
history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been
transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:
""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to
be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old
weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must
simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and
Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat
holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our
responses.3
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success
will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest
simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,"" which he describes as ""anticipatory,
precautionary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to
modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce
preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the
preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and
promote political and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and
its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State
Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador
to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to
discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to
prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the
contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods
and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a
leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present
uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted
international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon
arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities
are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their
responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to ""coordinate and
rationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of
preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,
or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different
organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6
An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union
(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the
United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until
September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international
headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable
personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former
NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,
Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin
Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,
the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid
Framework Agreement.
As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for
personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off
violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century
diplomats who can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate
force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to
address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and
imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the
world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using
military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first
day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart
Rambouillet and leave the ""negotiating"" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not
being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an
outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.
Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also
prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be
exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,
including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further
excuses against taking military action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.
Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding
war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the
administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for
conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the
administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer
turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,
""I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of
days, we would be at war.""8
In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a
menace— but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should
be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning
of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for
""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a
consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a
particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a
good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the
interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding
1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle
East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to
institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath
assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict
into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring
of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was
""60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision.""' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the
war.
And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to
try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that
the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force
in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create
a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international
coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it
would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in
Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military
commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support
of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the
whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a
successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and
support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first
time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition
forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General
Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit
American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military
commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public
diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American
diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to
convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern
front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the
size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to
the war.
The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes
and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.
Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.
As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level
our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their
territory or forces.""' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-
military decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his
book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and
Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a
number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on
tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.
FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most
valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any.""
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in
something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American
case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State
Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces
in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national
interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the
world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to
understandable consternation among those in uniform.
Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,
nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But
getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be
the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined
after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and
economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time
and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and
""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners
and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in
which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to
create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other
measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a
decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition
may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15
Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of
responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic
foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between
each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing
comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by
function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16
Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career
at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands
each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of
Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated
Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a
""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-theinternational- community"" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,
they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including
Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this
area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my
residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and
James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in
postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and
nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources
of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for
development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to
focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict
society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and
Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the
profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about
whether the United States should engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President Bush had
campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort
the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment
of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in
the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the
Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective
long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of
classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in
2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,
including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put
Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the ""Bush
Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,
determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other
countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security
throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force.""2°
The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of
U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of
responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming
the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including
Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years
faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22
The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning
for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the
immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order
creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by
others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking
back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances
is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on
budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more
comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability
operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a
reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,
corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health
officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active
and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core
group of domestic U.S. Agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments
and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11
countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250
active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now
at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding
capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or
""comprehensive"" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have
higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25
One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new
personnel specialty: the ""expeditionary diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of
course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed
abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the
effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons
learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest
posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first
requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central
Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special
career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an
investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask
diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more
than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the
same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this ""special force"" during their careers as long as they
have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those
who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The
department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a
career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for
the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID
commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered
about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State
Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the
lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no
question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What
national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-
conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we
will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not
have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern
American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable
future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from
Germany to Iraq."" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the
elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip
Bobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture
unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace
building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,
however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.""'
While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed
individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the
answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith
writes at the end of his volume:
For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the
people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of
action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *
terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a
condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a
lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to
be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one
goal.3°
The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,
working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the
consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out
by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by
effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.

Diplomacy Before and After Conflict
By Marc Grossman
Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human
history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been
transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:
""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to
be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old
weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must
simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and
Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat
holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our
responses.3
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success
will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest
simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,"" which he describes as ""anticipatory,
precautionary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to
modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce
preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the
preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and
promote political and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and
its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State
Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador
to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to
discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the
contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods
and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a
leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present
uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted
international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon
arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities
are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their
responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to ""coordinate and
rationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of
preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,
or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different
organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6
An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union
(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the
United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until
September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international
headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable
personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former
NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,
Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin
Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,
the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid
Framework Agreement.
As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for
personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off
violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century
diplomats who can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate
force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and
imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the
world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using
military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first
day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart
Rambouillet and leave the ""negotiating"" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not
being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an
outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.
Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also
prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be
exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,
including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further
excuses against taking military action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.
Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding
war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the
administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for
conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the
administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer
turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,
""I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of
days, we would be at war.""8
In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a
menace— but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should
be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning
of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for
""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a
consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a
particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a
good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the
interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding
1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle
East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath
assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict
into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring
of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was
""60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision.""' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the
war.
And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to
try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that
the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force
in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create
a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international
coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it
would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in
Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military
commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support
of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the
whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a
successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and
support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first
time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition
forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General
Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit
American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military
commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public
diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American
diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to
convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern
front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to
the war.
The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes
and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.
Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.
As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level
our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their
territory or forces.""' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-
military decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his
book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and
Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a
number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on
tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.
FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most
valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any.""
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in
something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American
case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State
Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces
in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national
interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the
world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to
understandable consternation among those in uniform.
Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,
nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But
getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be
the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined
after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and
economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time
and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and
""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners
and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in
which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to
create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other
measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a
decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition
may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15
Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of
responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic
foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between
each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing
comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by
function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16
Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career
at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands
each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of
Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated
Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a
""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-theinternational- community"" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,
they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including
Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this
area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my
residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and
James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in
postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and
nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources
of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for
development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to
focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict
society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and
Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the
profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about
whether the United States should engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President Bush had
campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort
the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment
of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in
the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the
Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective
long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of
classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in
2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,
including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put
Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the ""Bush
Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,
determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other
countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security
throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force.""2°
The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of
U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of
responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming
the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including
Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years
faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22
The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning
for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the
immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order
creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by
others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking
back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on
budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more
comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability
operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a
reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,
corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health
officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active
and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core
group of domestic U.S. Agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments
and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11
countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250
active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now
at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding
capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or
""comprehensive"" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have
higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25
One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new
personnel specialty: the ""expeditionary diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of
course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed
abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the
effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons
learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest
posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first
requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central
Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special
career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an
investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask
diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more
than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this ""special force"" during their careers as long as they
have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those
who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The
department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a
career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for
the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID
commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered
about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State
Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the
lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no
question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What
national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-
conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we
will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not
have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern
American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable
future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from
Germany to Iraq."" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the
elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip
Bobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture
unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace
building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,
however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.""'
While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed
individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the
answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith
writes at the end of his volume:
For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the
people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of
action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *
terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a
condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a
lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to

be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one
goal.3°
The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,
working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the
consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out
by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by
effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.

Diplomacy
Before and After Conflict
C
onflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in
human history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 2P-century
warfare, has been transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book
The Utility of Force: ""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our
conflicts tend to be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found
for old weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must simul-
taneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and Richard Kugler
of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat holds the key to the
world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our responses.'
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security suc-
cess will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest

simultaneous application of all elements of
national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,""
which he describes as ""anticipatory, precaution-
ary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an
expansive and integrated approach to modern
diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplo-
matic strategy designed to produce preclusive
victory will include conflict prevention, success-
ful negotiation, deterrence, the preparation for
conflict should all else fail, and efforts to estab-
lish order, ensure stability, and promote political
and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in
both the prevention and management of con-
flict and its aftermath. The conflict prevention
side of diplomacy occupied much of my time
at the State Department from 1993 to 1997 as
the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S.
Ambassador to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy
was a defining issue of the last third of my career at
State as Assistant Secretary of State for European
Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw
upon my experiences and observations to discuss
here the scope and complexity of modem diplo-
macy, the methods and goals needed to prevent
conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems
to be unavoidable, and the contribution diplomacy
can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practi-
tioners, we can now make better use of the meth-
ods and theory of conflict prevention. The United
States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars are two among
many institutions that have taken a leadership
role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitioner-
scholar, notes that the present uncoordinated and
patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects
the absence of any accepted international conflict
prevention regime or system of governance—that
is, of agreed upon arrangements through which
geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional
responsibilities are assigned, norms and procedures
are formulated, and actors are held accountable for
their responsibilities.5 He asks the crucial ques-
tion to all those who seek to ""coordinate and
rationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy:
where should responsibility for the tasks of pre-
ventive action be located—early warning, the
decision to act, the formulation of a response, or
the provision of bureaucratic and political support?
Should it be horizontal, across different organiza-
tions or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down
their chains of command?'
An example of conflict prevention that
meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), in close collaboration with the
European Union (EU) and the Organisation
for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and
supported by the United States, to avoid civil
war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to
recall that, until September 11, 2001, the pos-
sibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading
international headline. This successful cam-
paign of conflict prevention was defined by the
remarkable personal and institutional coopera-
tion between the NATO Secretary General Lord
Robertson and the EU High Representative for
the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and
a former NATO Secretary General) Javier
Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord
Robertson, Solana, and Ambassador James
Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and
Secretary Colin Powell appointed as the U.S.
representative to the effort and who, along with
Francois Leotard, the EU Special Envoy, played
a crucial role in negotiating and implementing
the Ohrid Framework Agreement.

As a direct participant, senior NATO official
Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modem diplomacy and conflict prevention to be
drawn from this effort, including the need for per-
sonal and institutional teamwork, the importance
of early engagement in trying to head off violence,
the need to choose the right people for tasks of
this kind (including 21-century diplomats who
can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity
of being able to apply appropriate force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems
to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict,
the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force
when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek
to address the underlying source of conflict when
force is or seems to be inevitable and imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations
in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show
the world that NATO and the Contact Group
were willing to make one last effort to avoid
using military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's
attacks in Kossovo. I was in Rambouillet as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs
to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After
the first day or so of the meeting, there was so
much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to
depart Rambouillet and leave the ""negotiating""
to those of us more junior. My strategy was that
by not being present, the Secretary of State—
and the administration—could keep a distance
from an outcome that might be unacceptable to
the United States. The Secretary had a differ-
ent vision. Albright hoped Rambouillet would
end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she
was also prepared for the meeting to fail, and
thereby all options for avoiding military con-
flict would be exhausted. Her idea was that we
had to be seen to be doing everything we could
diplomatically, including her continued pres-
ence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there
could be no further excuses against taking mili-
tary action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued
a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in
1991. Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of
Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meet-
ing in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show
America's commitment to avoiding war if pos-
sible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal
had three merits: it would give the administra-
tion one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it
would shore up domestic support for conflict; and
it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's with-
drawal from Kuwait neared, the administration
was doing something other than just preparing for
war. The President's offer turned into the famous
meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9,
1991. As Baker recounts, ""I was under no illusions.
I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that
within a matter of days, we would be at war.""'
In 2001-2003, the State Department lead-
ership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on ter-
ror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a men-
ace—but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct
threat to the United States; focus should be
kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and
supporting the new Afghan government.' Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement
inside the State Department since the begin-
ning of the administration, and there were some
who sought to move the policy from support for

""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward
an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in
Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department
culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a con-
sciousness of what the other side will accept.°
Kissinger did not consider this trait a particular
positive at the time, and the department's culture
of negotiability did not serve as a good guide to
institutional behavior for most of the senior State
officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was
so during the period surrounding 1970s détente
with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of
Iran, and the crisis in the Middle East and the
resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability
no longer served as a good guide to institutional
behavior for most of the senior State officials who
participated in the interagency debate leading to
the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning
for the conflict and its aftermath assuming—or
hoping—that events either at home or abroad
would turn preparations for conflict into success-
ful coercive diplomacy rather than the military
action that was ordered in the spring of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy
Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he
was ""60:40 against going to war.
... no organiza-
tion could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision."" Haass was operat-
ing under the belief that Iraq had weapons of mass
destruction; if he had known they did not, he says
he would have been 90:10 against the war.
And no senior Department of State offi-
cer resigned in protest. The department sought
instead to try to recreate the successful Gulf
War coalition of President George H.W. Bush
and argued that the United States and its allies
might compel Saddam to submit through a
deployment of force in the region in early
2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained
diplomatic effort to create a broad coalition to
move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of
a broad international coalition lost all relevance
on January 20, 2003, when the French govern-
ment announced that it would never support
a second UN Security Council resolution to
authorize the use of force in Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated,
one job of diplomats is to support military com-
manders in getting what they need to make
conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians.
This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War,
which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's sup-
port of American efforts. The diplomatic effort
to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved
the whole of the U.S. Government and the
governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue
a successful bombing campaign, diplomats in
many NATO countries arranged for overflight
and support for Allied forces. A similar effort by
U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied dip-
lomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with
Central Asian states on security issues for the
first time in order to achieve transit, overflight,
and bed-down rights for American and coali-
tion forces before the October 7, 2001, begin-
ning of action in Afghanistan.

Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003,
and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S.
Central Command commander General Tommy
Franks in order to make the war as short and suc-
cessful as possible and to limit American, allied,
and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats
worked with military commanders to seek access
to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in
the public diplomacy effort to gain as much sup-
port as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq.
American diplomats and Pentagon officials again
paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort
to convince the Turks to allow the 46 Infantry
Division to transit that country to create a north-
ern front in the battle against Saddam's forces.
Although the State Department worried about
the size of the Department of Defense (DOD)
request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon
to try to meet the need that had been identi-
fied by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parlia-
ment, which reflected strong public opposition
to the war.
The way the debate about using force is
carried out inside the government influences
attitudes and actions during and after conflict
as well as future decisions on whether or not to
use force. Military force may restore security, but
it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of
conflict. As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engag-
ing in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms,
since at all but the most basic tactical level our
objectives tend to concern the intentions of the
people and their leaders rather than their territory
or forces.""2 Smith argues that the civil-military
structure designed to make political-military
decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts
decisionmaking in many ways."" In his book,
Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign
and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Ministry
of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address
the genocide taking place over a number of weeks
in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events
in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must
be done. We can't have people being
massacred. As a permanent member
of the UN Security Council we can-
not be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We
are not clear who is doing the kill-
ing: is it tribe on tribe, or is it a force
found from a tribe? And Rwanda is
a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital
and we would want an airheacl.

FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK. But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the
most valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any.'4
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated
in something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American case,
that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State Department's
inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces in an increasing
number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national interests. While this readi-
ness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the world was a direct result of the
lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to understandable consternation among
those in uniform.

Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet, nonprolifera-
tion—that will be part of any definition of successful 21-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict
diplomacy right--creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be the most crucial of all.
This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined after the fact, further com-
plicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and economic development cannot be
delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time and patience is a necessity on the ground.
However, patience is limited in home countries, and ""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for
failure is high. Industrial war produced winners and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn,
and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in which the
political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to create a conceptual
space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other measures to create a desired politi-
cal outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a decisive strategic victory was the hallmark
of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of
war amongst the people .15

Smith's point can be pressed even further by
recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's
rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objec-
tives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous
geographic boundaries (areas of responsibility)
and will assign specific units to be responsible for
every inch of ground or cubic foot of airspace.
There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and
expected actions between each individual Soldier
or Marine on the ground and the commanding
general. Nothing comparable exists for economic
development in governance tasks, which tend to
be assigned by function rather than local geogra-
phy or rigid hierarchy of authority.'6
Postconflict diplomacy was among the
defining diplomatic issues of the last third of
my career at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in
1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the moun-
tains between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in
harsh conditions, they began to starve by the
thousands each day. I was then the Deputy Chief
of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership
of Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American
diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of govern-
ments and nongovernmental organizations, initi-
ated Operation Provide Comfort (which became
Operation Northern Watch). This was not just
a ""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-the-
international-community"" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the
Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once
home, they needed to be protected, and for 11
years, the United Sates and some of its allies,
including Turkey, worked on the ground there to
recreate a functioning society and then protected
this area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity
in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian
leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my residence
while I was Ambassador to Turkey."" As one of
Holbrooke's successors as Assistant Secretary for
European Affairs, I watched the effort made by
Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and James Dobbins
to implement the Dayton Accords by applying
whole-of-government efforts in postconflict post-
Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread
again as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs promoting reconciliation, development,
political progress, and nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in
Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the
resources of the United States and other gov-
ernments to try to create the conceptual space
for development and sustained peace. The U.S.
effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need
to focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral.
approach, which included disarmament, demo-
bilization, and reintegration of former combat-
ants and promoted justice in postconflict soci-
ety. But the main events in modern diplomacy's
postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy
in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall
the profound disagreement inside the U.S.
Government, especially between DOD and
State, about whether the United States should
engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President
Bush had campaigned against in 2000. State
Department professionals were generally proud

of the effort the United States had made in
nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, support-
ing the deployment of U.S. military forces to
participate, for example, in the Multinational
Force and Observers in the Sinai and in peace-
keeping and nationbuilding activities in East
Timor, Haiti, and the Balkans. Most believed
that nationbuilding, properly funded and exe-
cuted, was an effective long-term tool of inte-
grated modem diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan govern-
ment after the overthrow of the Taliban was a
piece of classical diplomacy carried out in the
21-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional nego-
tiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in 2001
to create a new Afghan government. To succeed,
Dobbins worked with all the key players, includ-
ing representatives from Iran, to support a major
role for the United Nations and put Hamid Karzai
in position to lead a new Afghanistan.'9 But, as
Dobbins has written, the ""Bush Administration,
having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new
government in Kabul, determined that American
troops would do no peacekeeping and that peace-
keepers from other countries would not be allowed
to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public
security throughout the rest of the country would
be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force.”""
The struggle over nationbuilding also
hampered American attempts to get sufficient
amounts of U.S. or international assistance to
Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion
of responsibility there, with the British taking
charge of countemarcotics, the Italians reform-
ing the justice sector, and the Germans training
police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postcon-
flict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent
postconflict situations, even including Kosovo.""
American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the
Embassy in Kabul over the years faced the legacy
of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22.
The State Department participated at many
levels in the National Security Council—led plan-
ning for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning
was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of
Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not
have the capacity to take responsibility for
the immediate postconflict administration of
Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive
order creating a postconflict Iraq structure that
reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives
and lost opportunities so well chronicled by oth-
ers in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq,
although Dobbins's argument that, looking back,
the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished
a great deal under trying circumstances is worth
noting."" On July 1, 2004, the State Department
did officially open (on time and on budget) an
Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expan-
sion of diplomacy and led to more comprehensive
senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw
from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, includ-
ing a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this
journal chronicled in an article"" by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator
for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-of-
government civilian response to stability opera-
tions and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in
an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of
a reserve component, in addition to the existing

active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sec-
tor experts: engineers, lawyers, judges, corrections
officials, diplomats, development experts, public
administrators, public health officials, city planners,
border control officials, economists, and others.
Currently, the active and standby components that
are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID,
and a core group of domestic U.S. agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves
would be drawn from state and local govern-
ments and the private sector. Between January
2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed
to 11 countries, including Afghanistan for plan-
ning purposes, and there are realistic plans to
have 250 active members and 1,000 standby
members ready to deploy by the end of 2010.
There are now at least 14 other countries with
whom the United States allies that have a civil-
ian peacebuilding capacity—some including sta-
bility or civilian police, and employing whole-
of-government or ""comprehensive"" approaches
similar to that created by Washington. Several,
in fact, have higher budgets proportionate to
their gross national products than America's.""
One way for State to further support the
S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a
new personnel specialty: the ""expeditionary
diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel
have, of course, always been in one sense expe-
ditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is
deployed abroad the majority of the time. But
the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and espe-
cially the effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means
that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future dip-
lomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve success-
fully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
. Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction
Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons learned
with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who
have pursued careers in the toughest posts should
lead State leadership to conclude that this is a
step worth taking. The first requirement would be
advanced training, some of it provided by DOD
and some by the Central Intelligence Agency, for
those entering diplomats who believe they want
to pursue this special career path. These entering
officers would make an explicit choice and under-
stand that an investment in their extra training
would require their service in hard places, just as
we now ask diplomats who take the hardest lan-
guages—Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve
more than one tour using their skills. Since these
expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet
the same age and physical requirements as special
operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this ""special
force"" during their careers as long as they have the
proper training. This would allow flexibility across
the institution and encourage those who desire or
whose family circumstances might change over
time to participate as well. The department would
also need to make sure those taking this career path
are recognized for a career beyond the norm for
Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the
comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed
for the future, and this expeditionary diplo-
mat could form the backbone of the State and
USAID commitment to the civilian response
capacity. There are still key questions to be
answered about civilian capacity. In the face of
a real world situation, will DOD really support a
State Department–led operation? Will Congress
adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resur-
gent USAID work together? Where will the lines
be drawn between immediate postconflict needs
and nationbuilding? There seems to be no ques-
tion that the path is the right one, consistent

with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come
with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by
several authors,"" we arrive at this question:
What national policies, supported by adequate
human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a
preclusive victory? Nationbuilding, postconflict
reconstruction and stability operations, and coun-
terinsurgency strategy (call it what we will) will
be part of modern diplomacy for years to come.
Accomplishing this task does not have to be an
exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed,
one of the goals of modern American diplomats
will be to make these efforts more international.
But for the foreseeable future, the United States
will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation-
building from Germany to Iraq."" These lessons
include support for new institutions that bring all
of the elements of power and influence together
in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies
and friends have a chance to succeed."" As Philip
Bobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of
warfare to which we cling. This picture unfolds in
this way: peace making by diplomats; war making
by the Armed Forces; peace building by EUSIA1D
and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21""
century warfare, however, is that all of these tasks
must be performed simultaneously.""29
While the challenges and opportunities of
the 2lst century can be observed and analyzed
individually, none of them can be solved with-
out reference to the others. Diplomacy is not
the answer to every question, but it has util-
ity both before and after conflict. As General
Smith writes at the end of his volume:
For the general purpose of all interventions is
clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the
people and their leaders that the ever present
option of conflict is not the preferable course of
action when in confrontation over some matter
or another. This applies as much to the state
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain
them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the terror-
ist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing
an armed threat to people to establish a con-
dition in which to achieve its political goal. To
do this, military force is a valid option, a lever
of intervention and influence, as much as eco-
nomic, political and diplomatic levers, but to be
effective it must be applied as a part of a greater
scheme focusing all measures on the one goal.""
The connection to the utility of a mod-
ern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century
diplomacy, working to prevent conflict, trying
to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing
with the consequences, can be an effective tool
of national security if it is adequately funded;
carried out by well-trained, dedicated people,
focused on clear goals set by national leaders,
and backed by effective military force. This is
the diplomacy of the future. PRISM

""The Giving Pledge"" At-A-Glance
WHAT: Launched by Warren Buffett during the Summer of 2010, the Giving Pledge is an effort
to invite the wealthiest individuals and families in America to commit to giving the majority of their
wealth to the philanthropic causes and charitable organizations of their choice either during their
lifetime or after their death. Each person who chooses to pledge will make this statement publicly,
along with a letter explaining their decision to pledge. At an annual event, those who take the pledge
will come together to share ideas and learn from each other.
The Pledge is a moral commitment to give, not a legal contract. It does not involve pooling money
or supporting a particular set of causes or organizations. While the Giving Pledge is specifically
focused on billionaires, the idea takes its inspiration from efforts in the past and at present that
encourage and recognize givers of all financial means and backgrounds. We are inspired by the
example set by millions of Americans who give generously (and often at great personal sacrifice) to
make the world a better place.
WHO: The Pledge currently has forty participants, listed below in alphabetical order. To date, all
are American, although a dinner is scheduled in Beijing for September 29, 2010, in hopes of
generating interest for the Pledge among wealthy Chinese.

Thanks a lot for all the good wishes you have sent via Lois. It has been one of the pleasures of the last few months to see
you going from strength to strength. And the wedding looked fantastic!
Your message on Saturday was poignant. Losing is tough. When you win the party members and MPs doubly so. (When
it's your brother...). But I am so proud of the campaign we ran, the issues we raised etc. We got people to believe in a
New Labour platform - and modernised the platform.
I have announced today that I will stay in Parliament but not in shadow cabinet.
Thanks for all your encouragement over the last couple of years. I will let you know when I am in DC.
All best,

This is just for you because I wouldn't want anyone to think this is motivated by a desire to curry favor with my boss.
I know you're already fully aware, but with the shortened congressional work session coming to an end this evening, I
thought it was worth repeating -- we're really lucky to have Rich. He seemingly willed the latest set of legislative
accomplishments. In particular, the two defense treaties and the child support treaty never would have gotten across
the finish line without his leadership.

US major GE wins engine bid for Indian LCAs
NEW DELHI: US aircraft engine manufacturer (GE) Aviation today won the bid for supplying engines for the Indian
programme and the deal is estimated to be worth over $600 million.
GE pipped its European competitor Eurojet for the deal after DRDO, which is developing the LCA's mark II version,
formally announced that the American major's was the lowest bid in the tenders that saw a long-drawn battle for over
two years.
""GE was declared as the lowest bidder"" by the Price Negotiating Committee headed by Chief Controller for Aerospace
systems Dr Prahlada.
""The Prime Negotiating Committee for the alternate engine for LCA Mk 2 has finalised the comparative statement of
tenders...After evaluation and acceptance of the technical offer provided by both Eurojet and GE Aviation, the
commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE Aviation was declared as the lowest bidder,"" an official statement
from DRDO said in New Delhi.
The committee also had representatives from Defence Ministry, Defence Finance, Aeronautical Development Agency,
DRDO, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.
""Further price negotiations and contract finalisation will follow,"" the release added.
Though the order could be for 99 engines initially, will have the option of order for another 100 engines in the future.
GE had offered its GE F-414 engine as an alternative to its GE F-404 engines that are fitted in the first batch of LCAs that
IAF would receive in a couple of years from now.
Eurojet had offered its EJ-200 engines for the LCA Mk II aircraft that is under development now.

ZARDARI CALLS FOR FLOOD TAX
By Syed Irfan Raza
DAWN Thursday, 30 Sep, 2010
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari asked the government on Wednesday to levy a one-time flood tax on wealthy
people.
""A one-time flood tax will have to be imposed on the well-off and people of means to help shore up relief and
rehabilitation efforts,"" he said at a meeting of women ministers, parliamentarians and representatives of non-
governmental organisations.
""Unless we are prepared to share bread with our grief- and disaster-stricken brethren, we should not expect others to
help us.
""I have already advised the government to tap into indigenous resources wherever there is room,"" he said.

Subject: (Haaretz) Palestinians expected to leave direct talks
(Haaretz) - The Palestinian leadership plans to meet October 2 and is expected to officially decide to end
negotiations with Israel if the renewed West Bank settlement construction is not halted. Those expected
to attend the meeting include representatives of the PLO workers committee, the Fatah central committee,
and the heads of other political parties. After making a decision, the Palestinian leadership is expected to
announce that the final decision of whether to leave the talks will be made by the Arab League, who are
planning to discuss the issue October 4. The head of the Palestinian negotiation team, Saeb Erekat, said
""there are no half-way solutions on the settlements issue."" In a statement released to the press after
meeting with U.S. Consul General Daniel Rubinstein, Erekat called on the American government and the
European Union to force Israel to stop all construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in order to
give peace a chance. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the Palestinians would not be
able to remain in the peace talks after Israel's decision not to extend the moratorium. Gheit added that
""despite the international efforts, I am not optimistic [about peace talks]"".

Newsweek's Ben Adler: ""Why is Bill Clinton So Much More Popular Than Barack Obama?"" Here's a fun fact from the
latest NBC/Wall Street Journal
poll: Bill Clinton is the most popular political figure in the country.
The former president, who never won an outright majority of the popular vote and was impeached by Congress, enjoys
a 55-23 favorable/unfavorable rating. Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent according to the CBS poll
at the time, so his continuing popularity is not surprising. LINK

Subject: Dealing with Netanyahu
The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that Netanyahu is in a strong
position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with believed that the government would
have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts.
In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a
marginal concern. And this would have given him leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in
the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking
(70 percent support the two-state solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as possible for fear
that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud, who oppose
peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to keep Lieberman in the
tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the government now, and is willing to
do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about negotiating peace. But as the elections grow
closer, more and more of her party members are turning against the idea of joining the government. They are
strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly
down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The longer he
waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to oppose him in the next
elections.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775254 Date: 08/31/2015
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that he is
operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the belief that this
is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable price uses up a lot of
energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises doubts about his seriousness.
In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final concession, but only after wasting a lot of time,
making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners.
At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier""
(sucker) in front of his people to create a real problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the
cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he likes to
do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to broaden the
parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct negotiations provide the
opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of making a
deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further delegitimize its
standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama in his corner to deal
with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling relations with the U.S.; and if he
doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance the future he is most concerned about - a
Hamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky (unusual for
him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent terror because they
believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will disappear and then he cannot
guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate his
seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he
cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And please forgive
me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working with him,
even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge him forward, not to
buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2.Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own purposes. The
Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security, from the vote at the
IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted Bibi's security requirements.
That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in terms of
what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about Abu Mazen's
politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blame Bibi. But you
should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated solution and a willingness to
engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The Israeli public and the American Jewish
Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and they should be allowed to draw their own
conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations and time is not on the side of any of them. They
will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as we keep the door open.

Dear Cheryl,
Thanks for your trademark prompt, clear and courteous response. As always, it and you are appreciated knowing the
demands of your responsibilities.
I fully realize that the Secretary is engaged (understatement of the year), so I will wait on and anticipate her call as soon
as she has a convenient window to do so. The matters I would like to discuss with Hillary are very timely and important
but not urgent.
I will be available on my cell phone or through my assistant who
will be traveling with me. Coordinates in London are as follows.

Dear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.
Personally,
Mack

Robert,
Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn Macau)? There
CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.
The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In addition, he is
well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship by Wynn would be
well received.
I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.

Haiti Still Waiting For Pledged U.S. Aid
JONATHAN M. KATZ and MARTHA MENDOZA I 09/29/10 02:54 AM I 4'
Members of NGO Goal work in the Port-au-Prince streets on September 11, 2010. An United Nations report on the
impoverished Caribbean state, where a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on January 12 killed 250,000 people, said criminal
gangs are increasing their grip on many of the 1,300 camps where most of the estimated 1.3 million homeless are still
based. It painted a desolate picture of Haiti's infrastructure, estimating that almost a quarter of the 230,000 buildings
damaged, including about 150,000 hou
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Nearly nine months after the earthquake, more than a million Haitians still live on
the streets between piles of rubble. One reason: Not a cent of the $1.15 billion the U.S. promised for rebuilding
has arrived.
The money was pledged by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in March for use this year in rebuilding.
The U.S. has already spent more than $1.1 billion on post-quake relief, but without long-term funds, the
reconstruction of the wrecked capital cannot begin.
With just a week to go before fiscal 2010 ends, the money is still tied up in Washington. At fault: bureaucracy,
disorganization and a lack of urgency, The Associated Press learned in interviews with officials in the State
Department, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the White House and the U.N. Office of the Special
Envoy. One senator has held up a key authorization bill because of a $5 million provision he says will be
wasteful.
Meanwhile, deaths in Port-au-Prince are mounting, as quake survivors scramble to live without shelter or food.

""There are truly lives at stake, and the idea that folks are spending more time finger-pointing than getting this
solved is almost unbelievable,"" said John Simon, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union who is now
with the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank.
Nor is Haiti getting much from other donors. Some 50 other nations and organizations pledged a total of $8.75
billion for reconstruction, but just $686 million of that has reached Haiti so far — less than 15 percent of the total
promised for 2010-11.
The lack of funds has all but halted reconstruction work by CHF International, the primary U.S.-funded group
assigned to remove rubble and build temporary shelters. Just 2 percent of rubble has been cleared and 13,000
temporary shelters have been built — less than 10 percent of the number planned.
The Maryland-based agency is asking the U.S. government for $16.5 million to remove more than 21 million
cubic feet (600,000 cubic meters) of additional rubble and build 4,000 more temporary houses out of wood and
metal.
""It's just a matter of one phone call and the trucks are out again. We have contractors ready to continue
removing rubble. ... We have local suppliers and international suppliers ready to ship the amount of wood and
construction materials we need,"" said CHF country director Alberto Wilde. ""It's just a matter of money.""

Last week the inaction bore tragic results. On Friday an isolated storm destroyed an estimated 8,000 tarps, tents
and shacks in the capital and killed at least six people, including two children. And the threat of violence looms
as landowners threaten entire camps with forced eviction.
In Washington there is confusion about the money. At a July hearing, Ravij Shah, director of the U.S. Agency
for International Development, thanked members of Congress for approving the funds, saying, ""The resources
are flowing and are being spent in country.""
It wasn't true then, and still hasn't happened.
When the earthquake hit, U.S. agencies sent troops, rescuers, aid workers and supplies to the devastated capital,
Port-au-Prince. On March 24, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $2.8 billion in emergency aid to
Haiti — about half to pay back money already spent by USAID, the Defense Department and others. An
additional $212 million was to write off debt.
The heart of the request was $1.15 billion in new reconstruction funds.
A week later, Clinton touted that figure in front of representatives of 50 nations at the U.N. secretariat, the
president of Haiti at her side.
""If the effort to rebuild is slow or insufficient, if it is marked by conflict, lack of coordination or lack of
transparency, then the challenges that have plagued Haiti for years could erupt with regional and global
consequences,"" Clinton said.
That was nearly six months ago. It took until May for the Senate to pass a supplemental request for the Haiti
funds and until July for the House to do the same. The votes made $917 million available but did not dictate
how or when to spend it. Without that final step, the money remains in the U.S. Treasury.
Then came summer recess, emergencies in Pakistan and elsewhere, and the distractions of election politics.

Now the authorization bill that would direct how the aid is delivered remains sidelined by a senator who
anonymously pulled it for further study. Through calls to dozens of senators' offices, the AP learned it was Sen.
Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma.
""He is holding the bill because it includes an unnecessary senior Haiti coordinator when we already have one""
in U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten, Coburn spokeswoman Becky Bernhardt said.
The bill proposes a new coordinator in Washington who would not oversee U.S. aid but would work with the
USAID administrator in Washington to develop a rebuilding strategy. The position would cost $1 million a year
for five years, including salaries and expenses for a staff of up to seven people.
With the bill on hold, the State Department is trying to move the money along by avoiding Congress as much as
possible. It sent lawmakers a ""spending plan"" on Sept. 20 and gave legislators 15 days to review it. If they fail
to act on the plan, the money could be released as soon as specific projects get the OK.
""We need to make sure that the needs of the Haitian people are not sacrificed to procedural and bureaucratic
impediments,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry told the AP by e-mail. ""As we
approach nine months since the earthquake, further delays on any side are unacceptable.""
Asked when the money will actually come, State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said the
department expects to start spending in the coming weeks and months. He added that $275 million in ""bridge""
funds were released in March and have gone toward agriculture, work, health and shelter programs — not long-
term reconstruction.
Haitian advocates say that is not enough.
Jean-Claude Bajeux of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights in Port-au-Prince said this phase was supposed
to be about building semi-permanent houses.
""Where are they? We haven't seen them,"" he said. ""There is not much money that is being used. There is not
much work that has actually been done.""
Of course there is no guarantee that the money would lead to the successful rebuilding of Haiti. Many past U.S.
aid efforts have fallen short.
""I don't think (the money) will make any difference,"" said Haitian human rights advocate Pierre Esperance.
""Haitian people are not really involved in this process.""
But officials agree the funds could pay for new approaches to make Haiti more sustainable, and rebuilding
projects could improve millions of lives.
The AP found that $874 million of the funds pledged by other countries at the donors conference was money
already promised to Haiti for work or aid before the quake. An additional $1.13 million wasn't ever going to be
sent; it was debt relief. And $184 million was in loans to Haiti's government, not aid.
The Office of the Special Envoy has been tracking the money delivered so far but does not know who got it.
The envoy himself, former President Bill Clinton, told the AP in July and again in August that he was putting
pressure on donors to meet their pledges.

On the streets of Haiti, many simply feel abandoned. Mishna Gregoire, 22, said she was happy when she heard
about the donors conference. But six months later she is still in a tarp city with 5,000 other people, on a foul-
smelling plaza in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petionville.
""I thought it was something serious they were really going to do,"" Gregoire said, standing amid tarps torn apart
by the sudden storm. ""But nothing has been done. And I don't think anything will be done.""

It's fair for smaller countries to turn to international conventions
MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew supports the use of international conventions to solve border disputes, especially when
the countries involved are not of equal standing.
By way of illustration, he said it was ""fair"" for smaller countries like Vietnam to resolve disputes with China using
conventions like Unclos — the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
He made the point at a dialogue of the Russia-Singapore Business Forum yesterday, when he was asked by former
Japanese senator Kotaro Tamura to comment on the ongoing China-Japan dispute.
Mr Tamura, in his question, made his feelings clear, describing China as a ""teenager"" in its handling of the situation.
Adding that China was also pushing around other countries like those in South-east Asia, he asked if it was a good idea
for countries with potential border problems to team up and take China into a multilateral negotiation.
Mr Lee, in his response, noted that multiparty negotiations had been proposed by United States Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in a visit to Vietnam this July.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775280 Date: 08/31/2015
But Mrs Clinton's statement had upset China, he added.
Mr Lee said: ""It was a really quiet statement but I think it also drew a line, a red line which will not make the Chinese
very happy.
""As you can see its foreign minister says it's none of America's business, it is a bilateral matter with the Philippines, with
Brunei, with Vietnam.""
The three South-east Asian countries, China and some others have all laid claim — either in whole or in part —to the
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
But any bilateral negotiation with China is unlikely to be a fair fight, he said.
""So if you deal with China, and Vietnam with 100 million (people) and they've got 1,300 million, where is your punching
power?"" he asked.
He cited a 2008 dispute over a deal Vietnam made with US oil giant ExxonMobil to do oil exploration in contested
waters.
""The Chinese told ExxonMobil: 'Move on or you'll get no business from China.' So ExxonMobil moved on,"" he said. That
is why, he said, a multilateral, Unclos- based solution was just.
He stressed that negotiations needed to be based on internationally accepted rules.
Mrs Clinton, he said, probably did not act independently when making the statement in Hanoi and would have consulted
her country's national security lobby and even the President.
He said the US policy made it clear that territorial claims were more complex than producing a map with dotted lines
and saying: ""All this is mine"".
""I mean who produces this map? What is the authenticity of this map? Who kept it? And even if you can prove its
antiquity, what does it show?
""It shows that at that time these countries were not independent and (were) under French, American or British or other
rule and so they could not object.
""But now they're independent and they're entitled to protest. It's within their EEZ (exclusive economic zone); it's within
their territorial waters,""
he said.
Mr Lee said the points made by the US in Hanoi draw an ""important line against bilateral dealings which are unequal"".
He also spoke on Japan's current spat with China, the worst between the two countries in years, which was sparked
earlier this month when Japan detained a Chinese ship captain following a sea collision near the disputed Senkaku
islands.
Japan, however, released the captain on Saturday.
Mr Lee felt that moving to settle the dispute was probably the right thing to do.
He said: ""Supposing he (Japanese PM Naoto Kan) decided to do otherwise, then what? Then the Senkaku islands will
become a dispute. Then they will send their navy there. Then you will send your navy there.

bigger fleet than you have, so you have to factor that into your calculation.

A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about
negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against
the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that
he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the
belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable
price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises
doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final
concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no
credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This
combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real
problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he
likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to
broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct
negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of
making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further
delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President
Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling
relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance
the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky
(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent
terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will
disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi
doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been
seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but
that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And
please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working
with him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge
him forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own
purposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security,
from the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted
Bibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in
terms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about
Abu Mazen's politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blame
Bibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated
solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The
Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and
they should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations
and time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as
we keep the door open.

Subject: Martin Indyk sent this to Jeff Feltman -- very interesting analysis
Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth reading
A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about

the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.

MEDIA NOTE
Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections
Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will
supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan,
and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and
liabilities.
We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to
be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and
international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.

US Foreign Policy: Waiting on a Sun King By Edward Luce and Daniel Dombey Financial Times
Published: March 30 2010
For better or for worse, Washington has grown used to the fact that Barack Obama runs the most centralised — or
""White House-centric"" — administration since Richard Nixon. When Nixon wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew
where he got it from: Henry Kissinger, variously his national security adviser and secretary of state.
In contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policy strategist. Even insiders give different answers when asked to whom he
turns for advice on the big international questions. But almost all agree with the following observation. ""The truth is that
President Obama is his own Henry Kissinger — no one else plays that role,"" says a senior official. ""Every administration
reflects the personality of the president. This president wants all the trains routed through the Oval Office.""
Fifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.
But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to
speak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a
long time around, Mr Obama himself.
Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the
passage last week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign
policy itself, his centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential
attention, say critics.
""On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely,"" says the official. ""On the debit
side, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't have
much depth on some issues.""
The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises
the president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,
military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many
people's surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.
Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little
interest in running the ""inter-agency"" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775305 Date: 08/31/2015

frequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National
Security Council, known as the ""principals meeting"", not Gen Jones.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. ""If you were to ask me who the real national security
adviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rahm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least
important,"" says another official.
Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign
governments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he
does not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen
Jones provoked laughter when he said: ""I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did
what you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.""
STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS
An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle
If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the alliance between
Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.
Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working relationship with her
former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — if not at home, where Mr
Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.
Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the credibility he
lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a holdover from the Bush
administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the
only other unsackable cabinet member.
The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on Afghanistan,
where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.""
Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted,"" says one official, who notes that while the
traditional role of the NSC is to ""play referee"" between the state and defence departments, it is as often nowadays a
combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and
Colin Powell held those positions.""We work together well,"" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN
last year. ""I think it starts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge
that the secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.""
Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on diplomacy. As chief
diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough sanctions; on Russia, both have
sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations with the Kremlin.
But for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the Obama inner
circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant ""residue of friction"" between Mr Obama's and
Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief of staff, has had several run-ins
with others in the administration.
One official describes Mrs Clinton as ""totally loyal"" to Mr Obama. He adds: ""She and the president are not the best of
friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to a president and she wanted to
be one... She still might be.""

The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-
Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed George Mitchell as his
envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab
confidence in the talks.
In a heated showdown in the Oval Office last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand,
the only officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the
campaign. Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.
""The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what
the next step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?"" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration
and former head of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?""Mr
Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy national
security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent ""deputies' meetings"", which can
sometimes consume four to six hours a day.
Described by one insider as ""the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known"", Mr Donilon,
who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there
are a lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as ""clinically insane"" by a
former senior diplomat under Bill Clinton.
But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. ""People
forget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George
W. Bush's two terms] in America's power and reputation in our history,"" says a senior official. ""It took time to put in
place a process that could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.""
Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30am national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to
prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model de-vised by Brent Scowcroft, national se-curity adviser to George
Bush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of ""parallel
process"" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.
""If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in Iraq was taken, you cannot find it,"" says the
senior official. ""By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions.""
The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Donilon and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,
often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. Mr
Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.
All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton
administration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together:
""A lot of work gets done in that group,"" says Ms Flournoy. ""Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires
going.""
The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to
send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval
Office meetings.
But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.
""Time is the most precious commodity a president has,"" says a for-mer national security ad-viser.
""On average he is only going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent.""

The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine
room. Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis
McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are
widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.
Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's ""Lord High Executioner"", Mr McDonough ""has appended himself to the Chicago
crowd"", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's
foreign policy apparatus.
Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side
during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the ""en-forcer"" and as the keeper of ""message discipline"", a key element
of any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.
""McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,""
says an official. ""Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round.""
Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. ""Donilon has
been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table,"" says David Rothkopf, a former
Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. ""Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that
was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited.""Mr Obama has built
a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level meetings without
decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy, which continues to
drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.
And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they
are absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in July 2011 — a
recommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.
On the plus side, Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus
side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.
Bush.""At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made
with a real lawyer's clarity,"" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton.
""When the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.""
When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.

side, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't have
much depth on some issues.""
The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises
the president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,
military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/Oc0c8c5a-c002-11dd-9222-0000779fdl8c.html> , whom, to many people's surprise, Mr
Obama brought in as his national security adviser.
Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little
interest in running the ""inter-agency"" process— a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels
frequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National
Security Council, known as the ""principals meeting"", not Gen Jones.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. ""If you were to ask me who the real national security
adviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rahm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least
important,"" says another official.
Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign
governments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he
does not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen
Jones provoked laughter when he said: ""I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did
what you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.""
The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-
Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed George Mitchell
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b904d928-29ef-ildf-b940-00144feabdc0.htrni> as his envoy. Three months later, Mr
Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab confidence in the talks.
In a heated showdown in the Oval Office <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1.59f9c90-43e1-11de-a9be-00144feabdc0.html>
last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand, the only officials present were Mr Emanuel
and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign. Gen Jones was not there. The fallout
put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.
""The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what
the next step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?"" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration
and former head of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?""
Mr Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy
national security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent ""deputies' meetings"", which
can sometimes consume four to six hours a day.
Described by one insider as ""the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known"", Mr Donilon,
who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there
are a lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as ""clinically insane"" by a
former senior diplomat under Bill Clinton.

But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. ""People
forget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George
W. Bush's two terms] in America's power and reputation in our history,"" says a senior official. ""It took time to put in
place a process that could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.""
Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30am national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to
prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model de-vised by Brent Scowcroft, national se-curity adviser to George
Bush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of ""parallel
process"" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.
""If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in Iraq was taken, you cannot find it,"" says the
senior official. ""By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions.""
The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Donilon and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,
often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. Mr
Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.
All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton
administration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: ""A lot of work gets done in that group,"" says
Ms Flournoy. ""Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going.""
The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to
send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval
Office meetings.
But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.
""Time is the most precious commodity a president has,"" says a for-mer national security ad-viser. ""On average he is only
going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent.""
The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine
room. Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis
McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are
widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.
Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's ""Lord High Executioner"", Mr McDonough ""has appended himself to the Chicago
crowd"", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's
foreign policy apparatus.
Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Torn Daschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side
during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the ""en-forcer"" and as the keeper of ""message discipline"", a key element
of any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.
""McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,""
says an official. ""Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round.""
Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. ""Donilon has
been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table,"" says David Rothkopf, a former
Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. ""Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that
was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited.""
Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-
level meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade
policy, which continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.
And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they
are absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c4efd1d6-df74-11de-98ca-00144feab49a.html> in July 2011 — a recommendation that came
from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.
On the plus side, Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus
side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.
Bush.
""At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with
a real lawyer's clarity,"" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton.
""When the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.""
When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.

STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS
An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle
If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the alliance
between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.
Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working relationship with
her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — if not at home, where
Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.
Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the credibility
he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a holdover from the Bush
administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the
only other unsackable cabinet member.
The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on
Afghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.
""Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted,"" says one official, who notes that while
the traditional role of the NSC is to ""play referee"" between the state and defence departments, it is as often nowadays a
combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and
Colin Powell held those positions.
""We work together well,"" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. ""I think it starts with,
frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that the secretary of state is the
principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.""
Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on diplomacy. As
chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On !ran, both favour tough sanctions; on Russia, both
have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations with the Kremlin.
But for all their workmanlike co-operation. there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the Obama
inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant ""residue of friction"" between Mr
Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief of staff, has had
several run-ins with others in the administration.
One official describes Mrs Clinton as ""totally loyal"" to Mr Obama. He adds: ""She and the president are not the best
of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency— she was married to a president and she wanted
to be one ... She still might be.""

Preval rejects US advice on presidential election
By JONATHAN M. KATZ (AP) — 2 hours ago
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president on Wednesday rejected U.S. Senate recommendations on holding an election
for his successor, brushing off criticism that the current process will leave the shattered country without a credible
leader.
A report issued this month by Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, ""strongly encourages"" Haiti to let its international partners help restructure the eight-member Provisional
Electoral Council, which has been accused of corruption.
The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute over rival
candidate lists.
On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree setting
election day for Nov. 28.
But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a day
later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election body, known
as the CEP.
""I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners,"" Preval said. ""The senator's
proposition is inadmissible.""
Seeking to show the council was not ""hand-picked,"" as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of nomination letters
for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including the National Council of
Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian Vodou.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775309 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775309 Date: 08/31/2015
He also defended the prohibition on the exiled Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party in last year's elections, a ban that came
after rival factions of the party submitted competing lists of candidates.
""International donors need to look for an accord with the CEP and the political parties and the factions of Fanmi
Lavalas,"" Preval said. ""We are giving (the parties) the support that they need, and the factions need to figure it out (for
themselves).""
Preval did not discuss the forced resignation of an electoral council member accused of stealing a staffer's pay or
opponents' allegations that the council gave special privileges to the president's newly formed Unity Party ahead of
planned Feb. 28 legislative elections, which were postponed because of the Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated the
capital.
He also declined to answer questions about another U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report that criticizes
Haiti's earthquake recovery, saying he would address that issue at a news conference on reconstruction next week.
Elections have never been easy in Haiti, a country whose founding president crowned himself emperor. It took 186 years
to hold what the international community considered a democratic election in 1990, which was then closely followed by
a coup d'etat.
Preval, in fact, is the only Haitian ever to be elected president, serve a full term and hand off power to an elected
successor. Unable to run for re-election in the November contest, he pledged to relinquish power again as he did in the
1990s — after protesters alleged earlier this year that he was dragging his feet on holding presidential the election.
Doing so will require significant help. The electoral council's headquarters were destroyed and its records lost in the
quake, while millions of voters were either killed, made homeless or displaced. Its new headquarters is a former Gold's
Gym seized by drug agents.
The election will also be a cost burden for this grindingly poor Caribbean nation: $29 million according to electoral
officials at the news conference with Preval, $38 million according to the U.S. Senate report.
The Organization of American States and United Nations have pledged support. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
issued a statement Wednesday praising the decree setting the election date and pledged the help of U.N. peacekeepers
and advisers in preparing and supporting the ballot. Ban urged member states to quickly provide the money needed to
run the vote.

Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: ""Clinton isn't relevant and is out of

Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously,
he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the two countries
are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media together and will be
photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair House, the official White House
guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in the
course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an impasse to
direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the construction freeze in Judea
and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA Chairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin
direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is divided over this issue.

3 bombs devastated the shrine of Data Ganjbakhsh (the most sacred Muslim place in all of South Asia, and the shrine S

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore
I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed Ali Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.
The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani
society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.
We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend
their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.

Karzai firm on deadline for security firms
by Javed Hamim Kakar on 24 October, 2010 - 16:54 KABUL (PAN): President Hamid Karzai has firmly rejected a joint
request from US, British and German ambassadors to extend the deadline for disbanding private security firms in the
country, his office said on Sunday.
At a special meeting, President Karzai told the foreign officials that the private security companies had established a
parallel government in the war-torn country, something he would not allow.
Ambassadors Karl Eikenberry (US), William Patey (UK), Ambassador Rijdiger Konig (Germany),ISAF Commander Gen.
David Petraeus and NATO's special civilian representative, Mark Sidwell, were among the foreign officials who attended
the meeting.
Karzai issued a four-month deadline for dissolving all foreign and Afghan security companies, a move he believes will
help stabilise Afghanistan.""I addressed the problem five years ago but our international friends warned of halting
development projects,"" Karzai was quoted in a statement from his office.
""I again raised the issue three years ago and international community representatives asked for an additional two years.
But now the Afghan government is determined to dissolve the companies,"" Karzai told the foreign envoys.
Japan's deputy ambassador also took part in the meeting. The president told the ambassadors to convey their security
concerns about the implementation of projects to the government. Karzai would continue to meet foreign officials who
expressed serious concerns over the presidential decree banning the security firms, the statement added.

October 24, 2010
From: David Brock
Re: Memo on Impeaching Clarence Thomas
Lillian McEwen — a former prosecutor, law professor and administrative law judge --says publicly for the first time she was
romantically involved with Clarence Thomas during the entire time that Anita Hill worked for Thomas. She was
subpoenaed neither by the Democrats nor the Republicans during the hearings (even though she wrote a personal note to
Biden, for whom she had once worked on the Judiciary Committee, telling him that she had personal knowledge of
Thomas). Her recent interviews with the Washington Post (10-22) and The NY Times (10-23) and the ABC Washington
affiliate (10-23) are the first record of her information.
(Personal note: During my reporting for The Real Anita Hill, every potential friendly witness for Thomas was made
available to me through close Thomas associates. They held McEwen forth to me as evidence that her relationship with
Thomas negated the possibility that he pressured Hill to date him and also that Hill's knowledge of the relationship made
Hill angry that she could not attract Thomas's romantic attention. In his Senate testimony Thomas himself had made that
suggestion in an exchange with Specter. Thomas said he had tensions with Hill because of ""the complexion of the woman
I dated."" McEwen is light-skinned. McEwen, assumed by me to be a friendly witness, was NOT made available to me by
the Thomas associates, however. It is now obvious why. They knew better).
PORNOGRAPHY IN THE WORKPLACE
NYT: Ms. McEwen said that pornography for Justice Thomas was ""just a part of his personality structure."" She said he
kept a stack of pornographic magazines, ""frequented a store on Dupont Circle that catered to his needs"" and allowed his
interest in pornography to bleed into his professional relationships.
Dowd (10/24): In her interviews McEwen confirmed Thomas's obsession with women with ""huge, huge breasts,"" with
scouting the women he worked with as possible partners and with talking about porn at work— while he was the head of
the federal agency that polices sexual harassment.
Thomas testimony:
Leahy: Let me ask you — she has asked whether this happened — let me ask you: Did you ever have a discussion of
pornographic films with Professor Hill?
Thomas: Absolutely not.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
LEAHY: Have you ever had such discussions with any woman?
Thomas: Senator, I will not get into any discussion that I might have had about my personal life or my sex life with any
person outside the workplace.
Leahy: I'm not asking –
Thomas: I will categorically say that I have not had any such discussions with Professor Hill.
Leahy: Please don't misunderstand my question judge. I am confining it to the workplace. I have no interest in what may
be your personal life in this. That's yours. What I'm asking is within – she alleges within the workplace. Make sure I fully
understand—I'm asking you this question so that you can give the answer. Am I correct in understanding your answer,
within the workplace with Professor Hill, you never had such a discussion?
Thomas: Right.
Leahy: You never had such discussions within the workplace with any other women?
Thomas: That's right.
Leahy: Or with anyone for that matter?
Thomas: Right.
WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR
WP: To McEwen, Hill's allegations that Thomas had pressed her for dates and made lurid sexual references rang familiar.
""He was always actively watching the women he worked with to see if they could be potential partners. It was a hobby of
his.""
WP: According to McEwen, Thomas would also tell her about women he encountered at work. He was partial to women
with large breasts, she said. In an instance at work, Thomas was so impressed that he asked one woman her bra size,
McEwen recalled him telling her.
McEwen told ABC News (10-22): ""He was constantly evaluating women in terms of whether they would be a good sex
partner or not.""
Thomas testimony:
""Senator [Biden] my attitude at work was in my work environment my staffs were almost invariably predominantly women.
The senior person on my staff was a woman. I could not tolerate individuals making that environment uncomfortable or
hostile. I could tolerate individuals who had to segregate their language or conduct in order to get along. The conduct had
to be purged of offensive attitudes and I made a constant effort, and that was something that I was proud of and it was
something I am sure the people who worked for me felt comfortable with and understood.""
WP: In her Senate testimony, Hill, who worked with Thomas at two federal agencies, said that Thomas would make
sexual comments to her at work, including references to scenes in hard-core pornographic films.
Thomas testimony:
""If I used that kind of grotesque language with one person it would seem to me that there would be traces of it throughout
the employees who worked closely with me; there would be other individuals who heard it, or bits and pieces of it, or
various levels of it.""
SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE
There were five other individuals, including now McEwen, who had first-hand knowledge of Thomas's behavior as Hill
described it, but none testified in the hearing.
NYT: Ms. McEwen has generally kept a low profile all these years, largely, she explains, out of respect for the wishes of
Justice Thomas, who asked her to ""take the same position toward him as his first wife had take"" and not speak publicly
about their relationship. A former prosecutor and judge, she is now retired.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
WP: McEwen recalls writing Thomas a short note before the confirmation hearings, curious about what she should say if
she were quizzed about their relationship. She said Thomas preferred that she would take the same attitude of his first
wife"" who never talked publicly about their relationship.
WP: Angela Wright, who in 1984 worked as a public affairs director at the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission —
which polices sexual harassment claims — during Thomas's long tenure as chairman, shared similar accounts with Senate
investigators. Once when walking into an EEOC seminar with Thomas, he asked her ""What size are your breasts?""
according to the transcript of her Senate interview.
WP: Her (Wright's) story was corroborated by a former EEOC speechwriter, Rose Jourdain, who told Senate investigators
that Wright had become increasingly uneasy around Thomas because of his comments about her appearance.
WP: Another woman, Sukari Hardnett, who worked as a special assistant to Thomas in 1985 and 1986, wrote in a letter to
the Judiciary Committee: ""If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being
inspected and auditioned as a female"" by Thomas.
Neither Wright, nor Rose Jourdain (her corroborator), nor Sukari Hardnett testified at the hearing. As he drew the hearing
to a close, Biden lifted a subpoena for Wright to testify and instead transcripts of the interviews with Wright and her
corroborator were simply entered into the record then the hearing was concluded, and Thomas was confirmed the next
day.
Dowd: ""For the written record Biden allowed negative accounts only from women who had worked for Thomas. He also
ruled out testimony from women who simply had personal relationships with Thomas, and he did not respond to a note
from McEwen — as a former US attorney who had once worked as a counsel for Biden's committee — reminding him of her
long relationship with Thomas.""
INTIMIDATING A WITNESS
A fourth woman with knowledge of Thomas's behavior, Kaye Savage, was first named in a 1994 book Strange Justice by
Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer. Savage was a close colleague of Thomas's and Hill's in the Reagan Administration.
Savage was interviewed by Judiciary Committee staff after she contacted the committee, and a staffer made notes, but
she was never called to testify. Her story did not become public until Abramson and Mayer obtained the staff notes and
interviewed Savage, who told the authors of visiting Thomas's apartment during the time Hill was working for Thomas and
observing stacks of pornographic magazines and all of the walls of the apartment papered with centerfolds of large-
breasted nude women.
From Blinded by the Right:
""The biggest problem raised by the Strange Justice authors for the Thomas camp was the testimony of yet another
woman, Kaye Savage, who had not been heard from during the first round of hearings.""
""I called Mark Paoletta (a close Thomas friend and former associate White House counsel under Bush) at his Washington
law office and discussed the Savage matter with him. Mark had been helping me on all other aspects of (my) review (of
Strange Justice for The American Spectator) and we developed a plan for dealing with Savage. I needed to find out
quickly who she was and what negative information might exist about her before confronting her and trying to force her
into backing off the story she had told the Strange Justice authors. I was intent on doing to Savage what had been done to
Anita Hill and Angela Wright during the Thomas hearings. Mark said he would call Clarence Thomas (then a sitting
Justice) and see what he could find out.""
""Within an hour or so that morning Mark phoned me back. He said he had posed my question about how to discredit
Savage to Thomas, who knew I was at work on a review of the Mayer and Abramson book. (Personal note: I had
personally told Thomas this when I met him at a Paoletta family event only days prior). Mark told me that Thomas had, in
fact, some derogatory information on his former friend Savage; he passed it along to Mark so that Mark could give it to
me. Quoting Thomas directly, Mark told me of unverified embarrassing personal information about Savage that Thomas
claimed had been raised against her in a sealed court record of a divorce and child custody battle more than a decade
ago. Thomas also told Mark where Savage worked after Mark related that I was eager to hunt her down as soon as
possible. Surely skirting the bounds of judicial propriety to intimidate and smear yet another witness against him, Thomas
was playing dirty and so was I.""
After an excerpt of Blinded featuring the Savage story was published in TALK magazine in 2001, The NYT reported (6-27-
01): ""Reached at home in Washington last night, Ms. Savage said that Mr. Brock had tried to intimidate her but that he
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
had not told her the source of the negative information. 'I didn't think to ask,' she said. But she said that she had shared
the information about her divorce with few people and that Justice Thomas and Ms. Hill were 'primarily' those to whom
she had confided. 'He either got it from Clarence or he got it from Anita, Ms. Savage said. 'and Anita's my friend.""
(Personal note: Though I confronted Savage with the information in an effort to get her to recant, she never did, although I
made it appear otherwise by journalistic sleight-of-hand involving a written statement Savage had given me under duress
about her interviews with Mayer and Abramson in my Spectator review).
Frank Rich, NYT (12-29-94): ""This time Mr. Brock's partisan desperation has led him to a tactic that is beyond the pale of
even tabloid journalism and that would make any citizen think twice before speaking freely to any journalist: He tried to
bully a source in Strange Justice, a one-time Hill and Thomas associate named Kaye Savage, to get her to sign a
statement denying her own contribution to the book.""
Jamin Raskin, a law professor and associate dean at American University in Washington, received a call seeking advice
from Ms. Savage after her encounter with Mr. Brock a few weeks ago: ""She was distraught and said Brock was
threatening to reveal damaging information about her from a divorce situation unless she agreed to retract everything she
had said to the authors of Strange Justice, he said in an interview. 'I told her this is a clear violation of journalistic ethics
and might be blackmail and that she shouldn't give in to it. She was beside herself because she had told the truth.""
MORE CONFIRMATION ON PORNOGRAPHY
Blinded by the Right:
""I next set out to blow away the Mayer and Abramson story that Thomas had been a frequent customer of an X-rated
video store near Dupont Circle, called Graffiti, where in the early 1980s he was alleged to have rented X-rated videos of
the type that Hill claimed he had discussed with her in graphic terms. In the hearings Thomas had pointedly refused to
answer questions about his personal use of pornography, other than to categorically deny that he had ever talked about
porn with Hill (or with anyone in the workplace). The Graffiti story was another theretofore unknown piece of evidence for
Hill's case...""
""Now that Mark had opened up a channel directly to Thomas, I asked him to find out for me whether Thomas had owned
the video equipment needed to view movies at home in the early 1980s...Mark came back with a straightforward answer:
Thomas not only had the video equipment in his apartment, but he also habitually rented pornographic movies from
Graffiti during the years Anita Hill worked for him. Here was the proof that Senate investigators and reporters had been
searching for during the hearings.
NYT: (Lillian McEwen) said he kept a stack of pornographic magazines, ""frequented a store on Dupont Circle that catered
to his needs.""
CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION
Partial Transcript of CNN's Crossfire, 6-28-2001, after TALK published the excerpt from Blinded on Kaye Savage:
Eleanor Smeal, President of Feminist Majority Foundation: ""I think there should be a hearing. Not only do I think there
should be a hearing, I think that we can get to the bottom of it. There's other people now involved. There's Kaye Savage,
who was, in fact, discredited by Brock. There are other authors who have written and were discredited by Brock. There is
— essentially what Brock is saying they're very serious charges, they're not light charges. They are charges that he was
fed information, and being fed this information, they discredited people wrongfully and knowingly. And this is serious.
""And let's face it, the Supreme Court these are life-time appointments. We are sitting here with a Supreme Court that
elected this president by a five to four decision, but a Supreme Court that could reverse Roe v Wade and many many
serious things affecting women...
""Let's get right to — let's just get right to this, the problem with Clarence Thomas. There was a book that came out by two
reputable reporters, Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer. And it collaborated — it confirmed a lot of what Anita Hill said. And we
now know — of course we don't know this — it's alleged by Brock that he knew when he attacked that book and attacked it
systematically that he was saying a lie. And so basically that is a reputable account that substantiates what she said...
""Why don't you just bring it before a Senate judiciary committee and have Paoletta there, and not only that, why don't you
investigate? I mean in fact there were — it's not just one person's word against another. He said that he was a regular
participator in buying videos from a certain store. I mean why can't...""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
Robert Novak: ""Who said that? Who said that?""
Smeal: ""Paoletta. Paoletta said it to Brock but what I'm saying is you can check it. I mean you don't have to...""
Novak: ""He (Paoletta) denies it.""
Smeal: 'But that's a person's word. Is there no such thing as investigations? Is there no such thing as a hearing? I mean
and why can't it be bipartisan? If in fact it's true that this man is just a liar, then you clear the name. But if it isn't we get at
something also very serious. So — it's a serious allegation.""

personal life or my sex life with any person outside the workplace.
Leahy: I'm not asking -
Thomas: I will categorically say that I have not had any such discussions with
Professor Hill.
Leahy: Please don't misunderstand my question judge. I am confining it to the
workplace. I have no interest in what may be your personal life in this. That's yours.
What I'm asking is within - she alleges within the workplace. Make sure I fully
understand—I'm asking you this question so that you can give the answer. Am I
correct in understanding your answer, within the workplace with Professor Hill, you
never had such a discussion?
Thomas: Right.
Leahy: You never had such discussions within the workplace with any other
women?
Thomas: That's right.
Leahy: Or with anyone for that matter?
Thomas: Right.
WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR
WP: To McEwen, Hill's allegations that Thomas had pressed her for dates and made
lurid sexual references rang familiar. ""He was always actively watching the women
he worked with to see if they could be potential partners. It was a hobby of his.""

WP: According to McEwen, Thomas would also tell her about women he
encountered at work. He was partial to women with large breasts, she said. In an
instance at work, Thomas was so impressed that he asked one woman her bra size,
McEwen recalled him telling her.
McEwen told ABC News (10-22): ""He was constantly evaluating women in terms of
whether they would be a good sex partner or not.""
Thomas testimony:
""Senator [Biden] my attitude at work was in my work environment my staffs were
almost invariably predominantly women. The senior person on my staff was a
woman. I could not tolerate individuals making that environment uncomfortable or
hostile. I could tolerate individuals who had to segregate their language or conduct
in order to get along. The conduct had to be purged of offensive attitudes and I made
a constant effort, and that was something that I was proud of and it was something I
am sure the people who worked for me felt comfortable with and understood.""
WP: In her Senate testimony, Hill, who worked with Thomas at two federal agencies,
said that Thomas would make sexual comments to her at work, including references
to scenes in hard-core pornographic films.
Thomas testimony:
""If I used that kind of grotesque language with one person it would seem to me that
there would be traces of it throughout the employees who worked closely with me;
there would be other individuals who heard it, or bits and pieces of it, or various
levels of it.""
SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE
There were five other individuals, including now McEwen, who had first-hand
knowledge of Thomas's behavior as Hill described it, but none testified in the
hearing.
NYT: Ms. McEwen has generally kept a low profile all these years, largely, she
explains, out of respect for the wishes of justice Thomas, who asked her to ""take the
same position toward him as his first wife had take"" and not speak publicly about
their relationship. A former prosecutor and judge, she is now retired.
WP: McEwen recalls writing Thomas a short note before the confirmation hearings,
curious about what she should say if she were quizzed about their relationship. She
said Thomas preferred that she would take ""the same attitude of his first wife"" who
never talked publicly about their relationship.

WP: Angela Wright, who in 1984 worked as a public affairs director at the Equal
Opportunity Employment Commission - which polices sexual harassment claims -
during Thomas's long tenure as chairman, shared similar accounts with Senate
investigators. Once when walking into an EEOC seminar with Thomas, he asked her
""What size are your breasts?"" according to the transcript of her Senate interview.
WP: Her (Wright's) story was corroborated by a former EEOC speechwriter, Rose
Jourdain, who told Senate investigators that Wright had become increasingly uneasy
around Thomas because of his comments about her appearance.
WP: Another woman, Sukari Hardnett, who worked as a special assistant to Thomas
in 1985 and 1986, wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee: ""If you were young,
black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being
inspected and auditioned as a female"" by Thomas.
Neither Wright, nor Rose Jourdain (her corroborator), nor Sukari Hardnett testified
at the hearing. As he drew the hearing to a close, Biden lifted a subpoena for Wright
to testify and instead transcripts of the interviews with Wright and her corroborator
were simply entered into the record then the hearing was concluded, and Thomas
was confirmed the next day.
Dowd: ""For the written record Biden allowed negative accounts only from women
who had worked for Thomas. He also ruled out testimony from women who simply
had personal relationships with Thomas, and he did not respond to a note from
McEwen - as a former US attorney who had once worked as a counsel for Biden's
committee - reminding him of her long relationship with Thomas.""
INTIMIDATING A WITNESS
A fourth woman with knowledge of Thomas's behavior, Kaye Savage, was first
named in a 1994 book Strange Justice by Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer. Savage was
a close colleague of Thomas's and Hill's in the Reagan Administration. Savage was
interviewed by Judiciary Committee staff after she contacted the committee, and a
staffer made notes, but she was never called to testify. Her story did not become
public until Abramson and Mayer obtained the staff notes and interviewed Savage,
who told the authors of visiting Thomas's apartment during the time Hill was
working for Thomas and observing stacks of pornographic magazines and all of the
walls of the apartment papered with centerfolds of large-breasted nude women.
From Blinded by the Right:
""The biggest problem raised by the Strange Justice authors for the Thomas camp
was the testimony of yet another woman, Kaye Savage, who had not been heard
from during the first round of hearings.""

""I called Mark Paoletta (a close Thomas friend and former associate White House
counsel under Bush) at his Washington law office and discussed the Savage matter
with him. Mark had been helping me on all other aspects of (my) review (of Strange
Justice for The American Spectator) and we developed a plan for dealing with
Savage. I needed to find out quickly who she was and what negative information
might exist about her before confronting her and trying to force her into backing off
the story she had told the Strange Justice authors. I was intent on doing to Savage
what had been done to Anita Hill and Angela Wright during the Thomas hearings.
Mark said he would call Clarence Thomas (then a sitting Justice) and see what he
could find out.""
""Within an hour or so that morning Mark phoned me back. He said he had posed my
question about how to discredit Savage to Thomas, who knew I was at work on a
review of the Mayer and Abramson book. (Personal note: I had personally told
Thomas this when I met him at a Paoletta family event only days prior). Mark told
me that Thomas had, in fact, some derogatory information on his former friend
Savage; he passed it along to Mark so that Mark could give it to me. Quoting Thomas
directly, Mark told me of unverified embarrassing personal information about
Savage that Thomas claimed had been raised against her in a sealed court record of
a divorce and child custody battle more than a decade ago. Thomas also told Mark
where Savage worked after Mark related that I was eager to hunt her down as soon
as possible. Surely skirting the bounds of judicial propriety to intimidate and smear
yet another witness against him, Thomas was playing dirty and so was I.""
After an excerpt of Blinded featuring the Savage story was published in TALK
magazine in 2001, The NYT reported (6-27-01): ""Reached at home in Washington
last night, Ms. Savage said that Mr. Brock had tried to intimidate her but that he had
not told her the source of the negative information. `I didn't think to ask,' she said.
But she said that she had shared the information about her divorce with few people
and that Justice Thomas and Ms. Hill were `primarily' those to whom she had
confided. 'He either got it from Clarence or he got it from Anita, Ms. Savage said. 'and
Anita's my friend.""
(Personal note: Though I confronted Savage with the information in an effort to get
her to recant, she never did, although I made it appear otherwise by journalistic
sleight-of-hand involving a written statement Savage had given me under duress
about her interviews with Mayer and Abramson in my Spectator review).
Frank Rich, NYT (12-29-94): ""This time Mr. Brock's partisan desperation has led
him to a tactic that is beyond the pale of even tabloid journalism and that would
make any citizen think twice before speaking freely to any journalist: He tried to
bully a source in Strange Justice, a one-time Hill and Thomas associate named Kaye
Savage, to get her to sign a statement denying her own contribution to the book.""
Jamin Raskin, a law professor and associate dean at American University in
Washington, received a call seeking advice from Ms. Savage after her encounter with

Mr. Brock a few weeks ago: ""She was distraught and said Brock was threatening to
reveal damaging information about her from a divorce situation unless she agreed
to retract everything she had said to the authors of Strange Justice, he said in an
interview. 'I told her this is a clear violation of journalistic ethics and might be
blackmail and that she shouldn't give in to it. She was beside herself because she had
told the truth.""
MORE CONFIRMATION ON PORNOGRAPHY
Blinded by the Right:
""I next set out to blow away the Mayer and Abramson story that Thomas had been a
frequent customer of an X-rated video store near Dupont Circle, called Graffiti,
where in the early 1980s he was alleged to have rented X-rated videos of the type
that Hill claimed he had discussed with her in graphic terms. In the hearings Thomas
had pointedly refused to answer questions about his personal use of pornography,
other than to categorically deny that he had ever talked about porn with Hill (or
with anyone in the workplace). The Graffiti story was another theretofore unknown
piece of evidence for Hill's case...""
""Now that Mark had opened up a channel directly to Thomas, I asked him to find out
for me whether Thomas had owned the video equipment needed to view movies at
home in the early 1980s...Mark came back with a straightforward answer: Thomas
not only had the video equipment in his apartment, but he also habitually rented
pornographic movies from Graffiti during the years Anita Hill worked for him. Here
was the proof that Senate investigators and reporters had been searching for during
the hearings.
NYT: (Lillian McEwen) said he kept a stack of pornographic magazines, ""frequented
a store on Dupont Circle that catered to his needs.""
CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION
Partial Transcript of CNN's Crossfire, 6-28-2001, after TALK published the excerpt
from Blinded on Kaye Savage:
Eleanor Smeal, President of Feminist Majority Foundation: ""I think there should be a
hearing. Not only do I think there should be a hearing, I think that we can get to the
bottom of it. There's other people now involved. There's Kaye Savage, who was, in
fact, discredited by Brock. There are other authors who have written and were
discredited by Brock. There is - essentially what Brock is saying they're very serious
charges, they're not light charges. They are charges that he was fed information, and
being fed this information, they discredited people wrongfully and knowingly. And
this is serious.

""And let's face it, the Supreme Court these are life-time appointments. We are sitting
here with a Supreme Court that elected this president by a five to four decision, but
a Supreme Court that could reverse Roe v Wade and many many serious things
affecting women...
""Let's get right to - let's just get right to this, the problem with Clarence Thomas.
There was a book that came out by two reputable reporters, Jill Abramson and Jane
Mayer. And it collaborated - it confirmed a lot of what Anita Hill said. And we now
know - of course we don't know this - it's alleged by Brock that he knew when he
attacked that book and attacked it systematically that he was saying a lie. And so
basically that is a reputable account that substantiates what she said...
""Why don't you just bring it before a Senate judiciary committee and have Paoletta
there, and not only that, why don't you investigate? I mean in fact there were - it's
not just one person's word against another. He said that he was a regular
participator in buying videos from a certain store. I mean why can't...""
Robert Novak: ""Who said that? Who said that?""
Smeal: ""Paoletta. Paoletta said it to Brock but what I'm saying is you can check it. I
mean you don't have to...""
Novak: ""He (Paoletta) denies it.""
Smeal: 'But that's a person's word. Is there no such thing as investigations? Is there
no such thing as a hearing? I mean and why can't it be bipartisan? If in fact it's true
that this man is just a liar, then you clear the name. But if it isn't we get at something
also very serious. So - it's a serious allegation.""

From: David Brock
Re: Memo on Impeaching Clarence Thomas
Lillian McEwen - a former prosecutor, law professor and administrative law judge --
says publicly for the first time she was romantically involved with Clarence Thomas
during the entire time that Anita Hill worked for Thomas. She was subpoenaed
neither by the Democrats nor the Republicans during the hearings (even though she
wrote a personal note to Biden, for whom she had once worked on the judiciary
Committee, telling him that she had personal knowledge of Thomas). Her recent
interviews with the Washington Post (10-22) and The NY Times (10-23) and the
ABC Washington affiliate (10-23) are the first record of her information.
(Personal note: During my reporting for The Real Anita Hill, every potential friendly
witness for Thomas was made available to me through close Thomas associates.
They held McEwen forth to me as evidence that her relationship with Thomas
negated the possibility that he pressured Hill to date him and also that Hill's
knowledge of the relationship made Hill angry that she could not attract Thomas's
romantic attention. In his Senate testimony Thomas himself had made that
suggestion in an exchange with Specter. Thomas said he had tensions with Hill
because of ""the complexion of the woman I dated."" McEwen is light-skinned.
McEwen, assumed by me to be a friendly witness, was NOT made available to me by
the Thomas associates, however. It is now obvious why. They knew better).
PORNOGRAPHY IN THE WORKPLACE
NYT: Ms. McEwen said that pornography for justice Thomas was ""just a part of his
personality structure."" She said he kept a stack of pornographic magazines,
""frequented a store on Dupont Circle that catered to his needs"" and allowed his
interest in pornography to bleed into his professional relationships.
Dowd (10/24): In her interviews McEwen confirmed Thomas's obsession with
women with ""huge, huge breasts,"" with scouting the women he worked with as

Mayer. And it collaborated - it confirmed a lot of what Anita Hill said. And we now
know - of course we don't know this - it's alleged by Brock that he knew when he
attacked that book and attacked it systematically that he was saying a lie. And so
basically that is a reputable account that substantiates what she said...
""Why don't you just bring it before a Senate judiciary committee and have Paoletta
there, and not only that, why don't you investigate? I mean in fact there were - it's
not just one person's word against another. He said that he was a regular
participator in buying videos from a certain store. I mean why can't...""
Robert Novak: ""Who said that? Who said that?""
Smeal: ""Paoletta. Paoletta said it to Brock but what I'm saying is you can check it. I
mean you don't have to...""
Novak: ""He (Paoletta) denies it.""
Smeal: 'But that's a person's word. Is there no such thing as investigations? Is there
no such thing as a hearing? I mean and why can't it be bipartisan? If in fact it's true
that this man is just a liar, then you clear the name. But if it isn't we get at something
also very serious. So - it's a serious allegation.""

A POSSIBLE US DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE
TO UNFREEZE AND DEFUSE GEORGIA-RUSSIA RELATIONS
Sunday, October 24, 2010
Georgia-Russia relations are not just frozen—they're volatile in ways that could
exacerbate current and prospective dangers regionally and globally. The deadlock over
Russia occupation and virtual annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia already.
....
— constitutes an on-going violation of international law;
— highlights the worst, most atavistic, geopolitically assertive trends in Russian
domestic and foreign policy;
— complicates Russia's relations with the U.S, EU countries, and Russia's
neighbors
— hinders Presidents Obama and Medvedev's joint aspiration for Russia to join the
WTO, post-NST progress on arms control in general and CFE in particular and
the prospects for strengthening U.S. and allied security interests in general.
— undercuts Russia's credibility as a European democracy in good standing and
worthy of further integration into Euroatlantic and global institutions.
The aftermath of the Georgia-Russia conflict of August 2008 also has the potential
to blow up into another conflict between Georgia and Russia and—even short of another
outright war—spread instability and political violence in the Caucasus (North and South).
Moreover, the situation, if it remains frozen and dangerous, poses a domestic political
challenge as well. The Administration's ability to influence Russia's behavior in Georgia
has become a litmus test of the ""reset."" For many in Congress and elsewhere,
the President's efforts to get Russia into the WTO, strengthen the OSCE and European
security, and move onto next stage of conventional arms control will be judged on
whether the U.S. is, simultaneously, able to advance the economic and security interests
of Georgia as democratic NATO aspirant. Conversely, any appearance of U.S. pressure
on Georgia to accept Moscow's dismemberment of the country will erode support for the
""reset"" in U.S.-Russia relations, including potentially imperiling ratification of the New
Start Treaty and the 123 agreement.
In this adversity there is an opportunity for the US to broker improved
communication between Moscow and Tbilisi, perhaps enabling them to reduce current
tensions over the territories and make progress on practical economic, humanitarian and
security concerns, potentially improving the prospects for a longer term process of
normalization and viable negotiations regarding the restoration of Georgian sovereignty.
The inter-state conflict is rooted in deep personal animosities at the leadership level in
Moscow and Tbilisi, a factor that is further complicated by the dynamics within the
Russian leadership (Putin's close association with the August 2008 invasion). Because
the two leaderships are not talking to each other—or, when they do, the situation tends to
get worse—the essence of the US initiative would have to be a shuttle between Tbilisi
and Moscow.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775424 Date: 08/31/2015
The near-term goal of the initiative would be to persuade the two principal and
legitimate parties, Georgia and Russia, that they have an interest in the taking the
following steps in three areas:
1. Humanitarian: alleviation of the displacement that was a consequence of
occupation/annexation, opening of borders for family visitation and people to
people exchanges.
2. Economic: loosening of economic/commercial relations between and among the
two countries and the occupied territories (including by establishing a consensual
customs regime on Georgia's Abkhaz and South Ossetia borders with Russia).
3. Security: resumption of confidence-building and crisis-management measures
(including CFE style transparency and CSBMs regarding Russian forces, Open
Skies flights, international/OSCE monitoring in the territories), reinvigoration of
negotiating channels on consensual security arrangements for the longer term
(Geneva talks or another forum) and transparency/CSBMs regarding U.S.-
Georgian military-military relations.
Under the rubric of security, it would be crucial that the US (and the international
community) explicitly reaffirm and adhere to nonrecognition of the two entities and to
insistence on the principle of Georgia's territorial integrity, recognizing that Russia will
adhere to its own position.
Modernizing CFE and getting the Russians back into conventional arms control
compliance are vital to stability, predictability and confidence in Europe and to fulfilling
the vision of a post-Cold War Euro-Atlantic Community which includes Russia and its
neighbors into a sustainable, increasingly integrated and cooperative zone of peace. The
CFE principle of host-nation consent to the stationing of foreign forces would remain
nonnegotiable even as the U.S. sets aside for later our disagreement about the ultimate
legal status of the territories. Our longer term goal in CFE is to reestablish consensual
security arrangements in the territories, not to settle non-arms control questions like legal
status.
Indeed, the measures agreed in all three areas above would be taken without prejudice
to the final settlement on the territorial and legal issues. ""Without prejudice"" leaves the
issue of end state open but maintains the opening and continuing US, Georgian, NATO
and EU positions intact with regard to what the legal end state should be if Russia is to
have truly ""normal"" relations with its neighbors and with the international community.
If there can be movement in these three areas, it might be possible to unlock other
issues as well, including WTO for Russia and the beginning of movement on CFE along
the lines of the NATO proposal.
Both as a matter of principle and US domestic politics—and as a matter of the logic
of the situation—it is essential that the security dimension be integral to the strategy and
execution. Security is at the core of the whole problem: Russian troops have, for the first
time in the post-Soviet period, invaded, occupied, and brought under the control of
Moscow the territory of a foreign country. While reversing that situation will probably
take years, the goal of doing so must be part of whatever diplomacy occurs now. And

that diplomacy is simply beyond the capability and attitudes of the Georgian and Russian
leaderships.
It will be critical to keep key allies—especially France, Germany, Britain (and
Turkey?)--closely consulted throughout, as well as the EU/Ashton and NATO. But the
initiative should be US only, and not get bogged down with all the other interested parties
appointing their own co-mediators.
Now that the Administration is on record—via the Summers public statements in
Moscow last week—advocating and predicting that Russia will be in the WTO ""well
before"" the passage of 12 months, the initiative should be planned as soon as possible.
The President might propose it, first, to Medvedev face-to-face in Yokohama on
[November 141 and then to Saakashvili on [November 201 in Lisbon. The initiative
would be have the status and support of a presidential mission, with the special
representative reporting to the President through Secretary of State, with the diplomacy to
begin in January with the goal of determining by the summer the prospects for success.

Subject: Thanks to Secretary Clinton for Participating in the Conference on the American Experience in Southeast Asia
Dear Ms. Mills—
Since the chain of events that led to the Secretary's speaking at the Vietnam conference started with my 15
March 2010 email to you about Brownie Ledbetter's illness, I thought I would close the circle with another
email to you asking if you would pass this letter of appreciation to the Secretary. I wanted to go on record
saying how much we in the Historian's Office, and how very much I personally, appreciated both her presence
and her remarks at the conference.
Best,
John
Dear Secretary Clinton:
Thanks so much for delivering the opening speech at the Historian's Office's Conference on the American
Experience in Southeast Asia. It was eloquent and affecting. Your speech welcoming the audience struck the
perfect note for (1) celebrating the achievement of the Historian's Office documentary histories on
Indochina/Vietnam and (2) using that event to explore the history of United States policy in Southeast Asia,
1946-1975. It also placed in context what we were about to do at the conference. We couldn't have found a
better way to kick off our two days of historical exploration than your speech. You gave us marching orders to
study the conflict in Vietnam and the American role in it but not to let that past blind us to the common ground
our two countries now occupy. And that's what we tried to do.
The conference itself was very successful. We have had good feedback from attendees and from participants.
The speeches of Dr. Kissinger, Deputy Secretary Negroponte, and Ambassador Holbrooke, sent out ripples of
stimulating and provocative discussion, while the scholarly papers presented by American and international
scholars not only placed their comments in historical context but also, and more generally, increased our

knowledge and understanding of conflict in Indochina. The official historians from Vietnam fulfilled one of my
first requirements—that we provide our former enemy's perspective during the conference. And the media
panel—with old Vietnam hands such as William Beecher, Edith Lederer, Marvin Kalb, Morley Safer, and Barry
Zorthian on it—added zip to the proceedings as well as substance to our understanding of the media role in this
conflict. (We put the media panel video on our website Friday, accompanied by a transcript.)
In addition to the preceding I also wanted to tell you how pleased I was to have had the opportunity to briefly
chat with you immediately before your speech, and last March, too, after I gave you the sad news about
Brownie Ledbetter. Throughout that March conversation I was also having an intense debate with myself over
whether I should or should not ask you about opening the conference. I glad I did and glad that you said yes.
I also wish to tell you (no surprise here, I'm sure) how well you are served by the likes of Lona Valmoro and
Lauren Jiloty. Over the spring and summer Lona gave advice and reassurance in a number of emails when I was
structuring what I hoped you would do for and at the conference. She went out of her way to be helpful and
positive. And Lauren, as the conference drew near, gave me the sort of precise guidance, and in an always
friendly and efficient manner, about your speech and the surrounding scenario that lowered my anxiety level
considerably. I am grateful to both of them.
Finally, as I head toward retirement in February, I wanted to tell you that we in the Historian's Office—and none
more than I--see you as a first-rate Secretary of State doing an outstanding job in, to say the least, challenging
circumstances. I am personally proud to have been in the Department and served while you were Secretary.
Again, the speech was great. Thanks for doing it.

Evolving Diplomatic Eco-system and Bangladesh Foreign Policy: An Agenda for Action Mr. numayun Kabir
The foreign policy of a nation is conducted through the institution of diplomacy. Obviously, any evolution in the diplomatic concepts, norms and practices affect the conduct of
foreign policy of nations. Bangladesh is no exception to this process. Rather, as a nation which is increasingly coming into global interface, understanding and appreciation of the
dynamic§ of diplomacy is all the more relevant and urgent. Let us have a look at how the changing global environment is impacting on the evolution of diplomacy in general, and
how the formulation and implementation of our foreign policy is affected by this process.
New diplomatic topography
During the last few decades, the topography of the institution of diplomacy has experienced significant transformation. Several factors contributed to this process. Recent intensity
of thick globalism has pushed deeper the flow of information, capital, manpower, data, images, goods and services. Such a process has produced a kind of paradigm shift in
international relations with corresponding change not only in content but also in the context of international politics and perception. With the emergence of +competition state,0
as articulated by Philip J. Cerny, where transnational powers are achieving salience through the exercise of power by many non-state actors, such a process has gained further
momentum. Intense competition has grown to sell oneOs story to the international community. Those who can successfully tell their stories in a credible fashion win the hearts
and minds of people, who in turn can become their friends, consumers, investors, tourists and promoters. In the same vein, the concept of national interest is being redefined in the
larger context of collaborative framework, as against the traditional setting of conflict and war alone. Continuous process of empowerment of people around the world has added
another new complexity to such a process of transformation.
Some scholars argue that as a consequence sovereign States+ monolithic identity has given way to multiple identities of sovereign people. A nation is now evaluated constantly;
government policies are being instantly and constantly reviewed and scrutinized by national and global society with clear impact on its ability to influence the perception. Indeed,
the network-based world is not only changing topography of sovereignty but also flattened the capacity of hierarchy based bureaucracy practically in all states.
Proliferation of many new actors in international politics and diplomatic arena has reshaped the global list of •Who is Who,0 and now the list includes NG0s, academics,
business leaders, international journalists, social entrepreneurs, foundations, philanthropists, and even celebrities, among others. Internet is extensively used to disseminate
messages, initiate dialogue, recruit new allies and friends, build network, and advocate a particular cause or issue. The development of complex international actors and network
has affected the international hierarchy of power in a significant way with the spread of huge horizontal contacts all over the world. In a globalised world, public opinion matters
more than ever. Being skeptical of the government, people are now demanding greater transparency and are ready to participate in policymaking process, which makes it difficult
for the governments to put 'spin' to overcome communication challenges. In January 2007, Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman and founder President of the World Economic
Forum observed, +We are witnessing everywhere a changing power equation. Power is moving from center to the periphery. Vertical command and control structures are eroding
and are being replaced by horizontal networks of social communities and collaborative platforms.,
New issues and challenges are also crowding the international agenda. They include issues, such as terrorism, climate change, nuclear proliferation, food security, disaster
management, peace- making and peace building, public health, and migration, among others. These emerging challenges have practically dwarfed the capacity of any single state
to handle them. Cooperation among nations has thus become necessary.
Several consequences flow from this process of transformation. First, as the global system is becoming more fluid and flexible in nature, and moving from multi-polarity to multi
partnership, as articulated recently by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the urgency to reach out to all components of wider global society, including the traditional state
centric power structure in a foreign nation, is being acutely felt. Thus, diplomacy has become a multi layered and multi partner exercise, characterized by the active involvement of
multiple actors, namely government, civil society organizations, think tanks, business associations, media, advocacy groups, church and mosques, celebrities, and even private
persons with global outreach. Second, with multiplicity of actors participating in the policy process, including various Ministries and Departments of a nation alone, the relations
between nations have thus willy nilly evolved from the phase of formal foreign policy interactions to a deeper phase of domestic interconnectedness, as evidenced in the European
Union in recent years. Third, everyday concerns of citizens have moved way up the ladder and become priority issues for the foreign policy makers. The role of diplomacy has thus
significantly transformed from a distant actor to an active social player and catalyst. The growing role of Diaspora communities has accelerated this trend. Fourth, the process of
diplomacy has also become more inclusive, hi terms of focus, economic diplomacy or management of resources has occupied the centre stage in diplomatic interactions among
practically all nations, including the most developed and powerful ones. Advocacy and activism has given way to diplomatic protocol and formalism. With the threat of extremism
and terrorism growing and the possibility of failure of state institutions intensifying in some states, diplomacy has moved from a role of passive observer to an active partner in
promoting basic values of justice, democracy, human rights and inclusive development, among others.
The New Hubs
As for Bangladesh, several regional and global developments are noteworthy. The rise of China and India, which is often called OChindia,0 offers both opportunities and
challenges for us. Already, they are our top import sources and could be major export destinations a few years down the line. ASEAN nations are yet another growth hub almost
matching Indian growth rate. They could be a good source of future energy, employment and technology for Bangladesh. East Asian nations, including Japan and South Korea are
already valuable partners in our economic growth; they could be potential sources of investment, technology and knowledge transfer to Bangladesh. Likewise, the Middle Eastern
countries have become the new center of Sovereign Funds and Bangladesh could capitalize on it. Of course, for the foreseeable future they are likely to remain as destinations for
our export of manpower. The United States and EU member states are major destinations for our ready-made garment and shrimp products; they could be markets for our potential
high value items in the future as well. Russia and other CIS nations could be source of technology and energy, and new export destinations for Bangladeshi products. Latin

America and Africa are still not high on our agenda, but both of these continents offer immense opportunities for Bangladesh; we urgently need to build our diplomatic bridges
with them without any further delay. It is important to understand that in a globalized world physical distance matters less than psychological distance. Clearly, in the coming years
economic diplomacy will occupy the centre stage in exploring new opportunities around the globe. Now the big question is how do these openings fit into our national priorities?
Bangladesh Priorities and Challenges
As Bangladesh strives to elevate itself to a middle income country, she will have to address several developmental challenges, which are closely interlinked. Let us now have a
look at some of the important issues, which will demand constant attention from the policy makers in Bangladesh in the coming years.
Strengthen Democracy- One of major priorities of Bangladesh in the coming years would be to strengthen democratic norms and practices. Being a socially driven nation, a
careful nurturing of democracy would be required in Bangladesh to meet the ever growing expectations of the people for good governance, justice, fairness, decency and
accountability in public life on a sustained manner. Indeed, the people of Bangladesh overwhelmingly conveyed several messages during the 2008 elections, including their
forceful rejection of any kind of extremism, in addition to restoring democracy and returning the AMaliajot• to power. Reading those messages in right context and responding to
them with appropriate care, creativity and dignity would perhaps determine the future course of democracy in Bangladesh. In addition, Bangladesh could also project the verdict of
2008 elections and subsequent forceful stand of the present government against religious extremism as a test case of how a Muslim majority nation could embrace democracy and
build up a society based on moderation. In any case, a sustained and creative effort would be required to deal with this insidious phenomenon.
- Alleviation of Poverty and Creation oflobs- Currently about 40% of people in Bangladesh live under the poverty line and lifting this huge group out of poverty will pose the
largest development challenges in the coming years. The present government has also repeatedly expressed their commitment to fight this menace through variety of programmes.
Another related issue involves the creation of jobs for the people. In Bangladesh, about 2.5 million job seekers are joining the work force every year and roughly 1 million jobs are
created both domestically and externally. A big gap always exists between the demand and supply of jobs. Needless to say, accelerated creation of jobs could also serve to sanitize
the society from all extremist ideas, which often threaten the basic fabric of our society.
- Infrastructure- This is a daunting area for Bangladesh to address. Several components could be put in this mix. First, the issue of physical infrastructure, which includes the
building of network of physical connectivity, such as road, railways, waterways, airports, seaports, and telecommunications, and IT, among others, deserves attention. In order to
accelerate economic growth Bangladesh has not only to significantly upgrade such infrastructure within the country but she must also align them suitably to connect with the larger
regional network. Second, Bangladesh will have to build up an energy infrastructure with a view to meeting the growing demand for energy as her economy grows. Government
anticipates that Bangladesh economy will grow by 8% by 2013 and by 10% by 2017. We must also not ignore the fact that the demand for energy in both China and India is also
growing at an annual rate of 10%, and Bangladesh has to be creative in exploring its domestic sources as well as taping into the regional matrix, which could perhaps meet the
regional demand for energy for many years to come. Third, building up a good managerial infrastructure through upgrading the quality of her human resources infrastructure is
also a top priority for Bangladesh. According to many experts Bangladesh cannot aspire to be on a higher growth trajectory without the quality human resources, both at the
government and private sector level to back it up. In order to achieve this objective, there is an urgent need to align the education system, particularly the higher education, with
global standard, including enabling students to leans several foreign languages and building an IT enabled generation as well as reorienting bureaucracy to serve private sector
driven economic growth with adequate knowledge and expertise. Ambassador Farooq Sobhan has rightly called them Aprivate sector minded bureaucracy.• Perhaps what we
also need is a globally minded bureaucracy, which would be able to effectively facilitate mobilization of private capital, technology, knowledge and knowhow from global sources.
Needless to say that Bangladesh cannot overcome the existing challenge on infrastructure without huge infusion of foreign capital, technology and expertise, among other things.
- Managing shared Resources and Environment- Like many other countries, Bangladesh shares vital resources with other neighbouring countries. Take the case of our river
systems. Out of 200 plus rivers in Bangladesh, 54 rivers flow from India and at least one of them from China. Nepal is also linked in this riverine network. While adequate quantity
of water is critical for sustenance and economic growth in Bangladesh, keeping a watch on the quality of water that flows into Bangladesh is also important. Flora and fauna of
• Bangladesh, and indeed the larger ecosystem in Bangladesh is dependent of maintaining the quantity and quality of water system in Bangladesh. As the demand for water increases
with economic progress. Bangladesh has to ensure its due share over this critical source of live and livelihood. Creative options have also to be explored to share this vital resource
keeping in view the growing needs of all riparian nations, including Bangladesh. Again, all South Asian nationsare more of less affected by the issue of climate change. Their
leaders have agreed during the last Thimphu Summit to forge a common position for dealing with this common challenge. Yet, the contribution of each country to carbon emission
and the impact which they suffer are different, and as such each nation will have to pursue a nuanced strategy to protect her interests within the larger context of ongoing global
negotiations on this issue. Likewise, Bangladesh shares energy resources with both Myanmar and India in the Bay of Bengal. Already Bangladesh in engaged in arbitration with
them through the multilateral process. It is most likely that more serious negotiations will ensue soon, and a great deal of creativity will have to brought to bear in resolving the
maritime boundary issue to the satisfaction of all parties, and to share the energy resources available in that region.
Raising Competitiveness- At the same time, Bangladesh badly needs to raise its economic competitiveness. Bangladesh has consistently performed poorly on Global
Competitiveness Index, and unfortunately changes in government in recent years have not had any significant impact on improving our economic competitiveness. Perhaps, a fresh
and professional look has to be taken by the policy makers on an urgent basis to complement the heroic efforts of private sector in raising our competitiveness. Otherwise, our
policy incentives will produce only modest results. On the other hand, an economically competitive Bangladesh will derive multiple benefits. It will open up more space for
Bangladesh in global trade; it will also attract foreign investment, which could play a vital role in transferring resources, technology, expertise and management skills.
Agenda for Action
A number of policy options could be explored to energize our foreign policy with a view to supporting our transition to a middle income country and creating space for advancing
our vital interests in the region and beyond. Our diplomacy produced good results when the global system was perhaps predictable; we need a new approach now to reach out to
new constituency of global actors in the fast changing global context Some of the elements for the new framework are noted below:
a. Redesign our Foreign Policy- Our foreign policy outlook and framework is at best traditional in nature, so are our diplomatic instruments. Dramatic changes, which have
occurred in concepts and practices in diplomacy during the last 20 years, are not appropriately absorbed and reflected in our foreign policy. This lag costs Bangladesh in terms of
effectiveness of her foreign policy. One example will perhaps suffice. The Embassy of Bangladesh carried out a survey among 1000 Nepalese citizens in four different cities in
2006 to understand their awareness about Bangladesh and her foreign policy achievements. Among other questions, we asked them if they would recall any foreign policy
initiative Bangladesh had taken in recent years on a regional scale. A large number of respondents only recalled the role of Bangladesh in the creation of SAARC in 1985.
Surprisingly it was 20 years ago by then! Such a response alerted us to the fact that we had fallen far behind in terms of drawing attention of common people with our foreign
policy, even within the region and more so in a friendly neighbouring nation like Nepal. Now, with a view to redesigning our foreign policy five areas could be looked at. They
include:
i.Adopting a look around policy, instead of looting in one direction. This would include exploring all options in building relationship with all neighbours on the basis of mutual
benefit;
ii.Articulating a Bilateral plus policy, which is essentially a process of working with multiple partners to achieve major policy objectives, even within the region; Such a policy
would essentially complement bilateral relations, not replace it.
iii.Supporting robust regionalism and sub- regionalism, which could create space for capitalizing on larger opportunities; This could allow Bangladesh to capitalize on its
geographical location;
iv. Pursuing a creative and flexible multilateralism, which demands nimble diplomacy on issues of common concerns;
v. Engaging in continuous innovations in our diplomacy, including building coalitions with civil society actors to advance shared objectives. After all, as Princeton University
scholar Anne- Marie Slaughter has rightly observed, the emerging networked world of the twenty first century exists above the state, below the state, and through the state. In
this world, the state with most connections will be the central player, able to set the global agenda and unlock innovation and sustainable growth.. Incidentally, the most
networked nations are not the powerful and big states. Singapore, Norway and Costa Rica are the ones, which are most nimble and active in this regard. Is not the message clear for
Bangladesh?
b. Expanding Outreach and Reputation Management through Public Diplomacy- As policy process attracts new actors, the need for expanding the outreach with a view to
incorporating the new actors into policy process and to seek their help to put into effect such policies has grown enormously. This could be done both at home and abroad. Many
countries, such as Canada and Norway pursue such a strategy with great effectiveness. This is particularly relevant also for nations, which suffer from reputation deficit, such as
Bangladesh. Reputation or image deficit affects Bangladesh at least on three counts: it deprives Bangladesh of the opportunity of getting a suitable context to conduct its diplomacy
abroad in an effective manner. British scholar Mark Leonard observed, ""Image and reputation of a country are public goods which can create either an enabling or a disenabling
environment for individual transactions. Work on particular issue will feed off the general image of the country and reflect back Onto it-in both positive and negative directions..
Second, in the absence of right kind of collective image we tend to either sink into invisibility or portrayed negatively; consequently we do not figure out in the global
conversations. Third, a distorted image, which often is the function of others defining us instead of we defining ourselves, affects our business potential as well. For example, in the
Middle Eastern countries Bangladesh is a major supplier of workers for the last 25 years; we contributed to their economic growth as well. Yet Bangladesh is regularly associated
with supplying only unskilled and low end workers. When the issue of importing semi skilled and skilled workers comes, they tend to prefer other countries in the region, for

example Sri Lanka and India. While emerging nations, such as China and India, which are carefully creating their brand image as a nation, it looks like we are frozen in Our old and
outdated perception about our inflated self image. Bangladesh needs to wake up from this slumber sooner than later. Experts have suggested a useful tool, namely Public
Diplomacy, for articulating a realistic and credible strategy to present the stories of a nation to outside audience. Indeed, many nations, including some developing countries have
already integrated public diplomacy in their foreign policy toolkit. Given the growing capacity and potential influence of Bangladeshi Diaspora in many countries around the
world, perhaps it is time to articulate a Public Diplomacy programme, which will facilitate their participation in the policy process, among other things. A word of caution would
perhaps be in order at this point. Contrary to traditional perception, Public Diplomacy is not about manipulating information to present official version of developments to the
foreign audience, nor is it an episodal shot to serve short term political gains either. It is rather a process of engagement with the target audience with a view to building up a
relationship of trust. Again, Public Diplomacy it is not a straight jacket affair, one size would not fit all. It has to be calibrated depending on the priorities and sensitivities of local
audience. For Bangladesh leveraging Bangladeshi culture and social creativity could form a credible plank of public diplomacy. It is important to note that Public Diplomacy is not
an end in itself; it is a support to advance the overall interests of a nation through reaching out to all segments of host societies. These days, some experts also talk about domestic
part of Public Diplomacy.
c. The Whole Government Approach- Our current foreign policy approach is highly bureaucratic, vertical and as such fragmented. Foreign Ministry is considered like any other
Ministry, while functionally its scope is global in the sense that the Ministry and the Diplomatic Missions protect and promote our vital national interests, spanning over wide
range of issues, around the globe, As the process of domestic interconnected has increased resulting in growing interactions among nations on a variety of issues of common
concerns, it has become necessary to articulate a whole government approach to deal with issues that have national relevance. Considering the value of horizontal cooperation in
dealing with complex problems President Obama had recently advocated such an approach in his National Security Strategy document of 2010. One could argue that the inter-
Ministerial consultations, which exist now, could somehow compensate for such a need.
Yet, the value of high level contact cannot be underestimated. One model for consideration for such high level contact could include a Ministerial Coordination Committee
comprising a cluster of Ministers, whose Ministries are directly related to issues involving foreign nations. This body could be represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Minister for Finance, Minister for Commerce, Minister for Expatriate Welfare, Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism and Executive Chairman, BOI, among others. A suitable
Representative from the Ministry of Defense could also be included on issues relating to peacekeeping and disaster management issues. Needless to say, all these initiatives would
bear fruit only when they receive strong commitment from the highest political level. The coordination role should however always remain with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
like the role of a conductor in a symphony.
d. Strengthening MOFA and Missions- Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Diplomatic Missions abroad have been given the responsibility to conduct Bangladesh
Foreign Policy in the most effective manner, several impediments have diminished their ability to perform at the optimum level. One is the shortage of officers in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the existing organorgam is outdated by thirty years. It is important to upgrade the same so that the strength of the Ministry could be doubled, as had been
suggested by Ambassador Farooq Sobhan. This suggestion is very much in line with what our neighbours are doing in the light of new global reality. India is expanding her
Foreign Service cadre, so is being done by China. Nepal is also expanding its Foreign Service cadre with a new law, which would give them the coordinating role on all issues
related to foreign affairs. In recent years, United States has added more than 1100 officers to her State Department cadre. Expansion of cadre is dictated by the fact that emerging
global issues have to be followed, understood, examined, discussed and negotiated with multiple actors on the global scale, which can only be done by the well groomed diplomats.
For Bangladesh, which has to leverage on soft power, it is the diplomats who also constitute the first line of defense! On the other hand, budgetary limitation has also stymied the
initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Likewise, Diplomatic Missions have lobe re-tooled with new mission to dramatically expand their outreach to all stakeholders and
actors, who can have an impact on Bangladesh. Accordingly, it is necessary to support them with research and financial resources. Enhancement in resources must be matched with
improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of Bangladesh diplomats. Consideration could be given to holding a kind of Quadrennial Review on Diplomacy to assess the
changing global scenario and to evaluate the effectiveness of our diplomacy via a vis such transformations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has launched such a Review for US
State Department in 2009. A rigorous performance evaluation mechanism should be developed to assess the performance of the Heads of Mission and other diplomats posted in the
Missions. Experiences of some of our neighbouring countries in this regard could be helpful. In order to ensure smooth and professional functioning of the diplomatic Missions,
the authority of the Heads of Missions should be further strengthened and the entire team should be responsible to him for performance of their duties. For some time, the issue of
the appointment of an Inspector General of Missions was on the card; it would be better to implement this suggestion sooner than later. Consideration could be given to form a
Foreign Policy Advisory Body with retired and experienced diplomats, who could advise the Ministry on various issues suitably. Many countries maintain such a system of
consultations.
Conclusion
Diplomacy has moved from traditional format of Club Model to Crisis Management model, from vertical bureaucratic model to horizontal network model. Now foreign policy has
to address two fundamental phenomena, which have characterized the contemporary global scenario: managing change and dealing with regional and global crises arising out of
multiple interactions of myriad actors. We therefore need a new orientation in our foreign policy, need more flexible and creative outlook, need new institutional mechanism and
need new set of skills to build coalitions with all actors with a view to managing the evolving reality on the ground. Above all, what we need is the attention and understanding of
the political leadership to lead this process of change. Reorganizing the diplomatic set up along with aligning other domestic setup to support the creative diplomatic endeavour is
no less important. Bangladesh has lot many friends all over the world; it is us how to tap on that goodwill to widen our space for building lasting relationship with the members of
international community. Let us not forget the hard reality that our effort to build a democratic, dynamic, decent Bangladesh in the coming years would be as robust and as vibrant
as our diplomacy is!

Subject: Trip reading -- Bangladesh is following the lead of the QDDR
This is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is not
just because the author – the former Bangladesh ambassador to the US—cites me). What is most striking is that it
affirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling
with. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world
after the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to
foreign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact. AM

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Protesters attacked a cholera treatment center as it was preparing to open in the city of St.
Marc, highlighting the fear surrounding a disease that was almost unknown in Haiti before it began spreading through
the countryside, aid workers said. Some of the roughly 300 students and other protesters said they feared the Doctors
Without Borders-Spain clinic would bring more of the disease to their seaside town, which is one of the hardest hit in
the week-old epidemic that has killed 284 people and infected 3,769, according to United Nations figures. Witnesses
said the protesters threw rocks and at least one Molotov cocktail. UN peacekeepers from Argentina arrived with riot
shields to reinforce police. Warning shots were heard; the UN said its soldiers fired blanks. There were no reports of
injuries. Haitian health officials assured the crowd the clinic would not open in that neighborhood. The 400-bed facility
was intended to rehydrate and treat people with the severe diarrheal disease. Doctors Without Borders-Spain country
chief Francisco Otero said the group consulted with local authorities and told them the clinic is important for stemming
the spread of cholera. He said they would try to reopen it in another part of St. Marc.

I just wanted to give you some background on the initiatives that New Zealand and Australia have put together to
empower women in the Pacific region and which they would like to spotlight during the Secretary's trip.
NZ wants to announce a collaboration between us and their government to increase women's political participation in
the Pacific region. Their development agency has made this a priority for the Secretary's trip. Our hope is that S will
welcome the collaboration in her remarks at a business leaders, et al reception.
Australia wants to announce a collaboration with us on an initiative to combat violence against women in the region. I
don't know where this will be included in S's remarks, but I hope it will. Both governments are committing significant
resources; we are committing much less, but Australia and NZ are eager to partner with us to address challenges in the
Pacific region.
I wanted to briefly share some thoughts on this formed during my last trip to China. It made the collaboration with NZ
and Australia on deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands on women and development issues that much more
compelling.
I was in Shanghai and Beijing last month to speak at the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) international women's
forum to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Beijing women conference and to follow up on our interest to launch
with the Chinese government the US-China Women Leaders Forum.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775470 Date: 08/31/2015
The ACWF is a mass organization affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party with strong leaders, huge resources and
powerful mobilizing forces throughout the country. The Chair, Chen Zhili, is also the Deputy Chair of the National
People's Congress, a former State Councilor; the President, Song Xiuyan, is a former governor of Qinghai Province and
rumored to be appointed as a State Councilor after the change of central leadership in 2012. I met with both of them
when I was there.
As I walked into the welcoming dinner in Shanghai, I found almost everyone I know of significance who works on
women's issues from Southeast Asia, the Pacific and Africa in attendance. However, I did not see government reps from
Europe or NEAsia. It appeared to me that the forum was targeted to engage countries and regions where China is
expanding its influence.
I know S is going to give a policy speech in Australia during this trip. I hope that you will include our commitment to
women in the Pacific Islands, especially through these proposed collaborations with Australia and NZ.
As you know very well, the 12 Pacific Islands, though small in size, represent 12 votes in the UN. They long for our
attention and collaboration. I think women's development issues are one ideal way to further our interests and
engagement.
Have a good trip!

You r doing a great job — if you weren't pushing...I could not imagine where things would still be with the IDB.
It will still be slower and more painful than all of us would like (but that is the nature of these processes as we know),
but things had no focus that I could see until you got involved and I think we might have lost the belief that it could work
without your determination.
Really — you are doing a great job and I admire and respect your efforts and don't know how you find the energy given
I'm sure all of the other demands you must deal with. You are making a difference here and that is what it is all about.
Please don't bother replying again Cheryl — I know how busy you must be.
Just keep going!

Subject: Update on North Park Meeting with President Preval and Request for Call on Tuesday - 2 Nov - 7am
All
I just wanted to give a quick update on the productive meeting we had with President Preval and his team of advisers
yesterday, including Gabriel Verret, to discuss a number of critical issues to move the project in the North forward.
The GOH has identified site 15 as the preferred site with which to move forward. This decision is based on the incoming
analysis from the IDB on flood risk & drainage, as well as soil and water studies. These studies point to better soil quality
and drainage on site 15 as compared to 14. Importantly, the analysis did not point to any flood risks.
The site decision enables the IDB to immediately move forward with the in depth environmental and social analysis,
which includes a water systems assessment to shed further light on quantities and quality available. President Preval
Identified site 14 as the back-up site should the assessments point to any unforeseen risks to the development of a
viable park in this location.
I think it makes sense to undertake a call on early Tuesday morning to review the status of the project, address
outstanding issues, and get an update on this week's conference. I have again attached the overall timeline of the
project and note that a number of deliverables are lagging and require greater attention to meet the agreed target of
beginning construction in January 2011.
I would suggest a call at 7am Tuesday morning given our multiple time zones. I have copied Joanne and would be
grateful if you could RSVP as to the availability of the appropriate representatives from your team to participate at this
time. Thanks so much.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
• It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department
• Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power
• Going forward, diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.
Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy and
development ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks.
In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review, commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the
State Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their
strategy and priorities.
The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both
Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about ""demilitarizing"" foreign policy, and Clinton
says the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,
much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.
In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be
implemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.
government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that
development undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and ""sustainable"" impact.
""Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the
world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'
national security strategy,"" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was
to ""put itself out of business"" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.
President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations
General Assembly when he released the ""U.S. Global Development Policy,"" which changes U.S. efforts to focus on
building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.
But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail
everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes
""stabilization"" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the
types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.

Obama denies batch of pardons
By: Josh Gerstein
October 28, 2010 04:37 AM EDT
After months of pleas from those who favor more use of the president's pardon power,
President Barack Obama has finally acted on the issue—disappointing many of those
advocates by denying hundreds of requests for sentence commutations and dozens of
criminal pardons.
White House and Justice Department officials confirmed that Obama has yet to grant any
pardons or commutations since taking office. Earlier this month, officials said, Obama
formally denied 605 commutation petitions and 71 pardon requests, a record that criminal
justice reform advocates find troubling.
""We'd like to see him being a lot more generous and actively granting clemency, but it
doesn't seem to be a high priority of this administration at all,"" said Molly Gill of Families
Against Mandatory Minimums, an organization advocating the elimination of harsh federal
punishment for certain low-level crimes. ""Obviously, there are a lot of political decisions
that go into clemency decisions, particularly in an election year.""
According to Pardon Power, a blog that tracks clemency issues, Obama is currently the
fourth-slowest president to commute or void a prisoner's sentence. Only Presidents Bill
Clinton, George W. Bush and George Washington have taken longer, according to P.S.
Ruckman of Rock Valley College in Illinois.
However, Obama's ""about 30 days from passing Clinton"" to become third slowest,
Ruckman said, though he added that details on Washington's grants of clemency are
murky.
Neither the White House nor the Justice Department would release the list of those denied
clemency by Obama this month.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775487 Date: 08/31/2015
Last month, the Justice Department argued in federal appeals court that the government
has the right to keep secret the names of those refused pardons or commutations. A
former Washington Post reporter, George Lardner Jr., sought the names for a book he's
writing on executive clemency.
Ohio State University professor Doug Berman, a clemency advocate, said he believes
Obama will soon grant pardons and commutations, which traditionally come during the
holiday season.
""Kudos to the president for acting, because simply not acting and giving the impression
this is going into some black box is actually worse,"" Berman said. ""Wishfully thinking, I
would hypothesize that this is a precursor to some future grants. ... Obama has been
disappointing so far in that he has sent signals he's going to do nothing or, as of now,
deny, but I'm cautiously hopeful.""
Margaret Love, a former Justice Department pardon attorney under Clinton and President
George H.W. Bush, said she'd like to see Obama grant pardons to some immigrants who
have long completed their sentences or never served time but now face deportation
because of criminal convictions still on their records.
""It would be wonderful to see President Obama take some action in some of the cases I
know are pending where people are under the threat of deportation,"" said Love, including
Chibueze Okorie, a Nigerian who is a Presbyterian minister in Brooklyn, N.Y.
In 1989, he pleaded guilty in federal court to driving a van for a heroin gang and was
sentenced to 18 months in prison. Since his release, his community work has been
praised by officials, including former Sen. Hillary Clinton, now Obama's secretary of state.
But under a 1996 law, Okorie might be forced to leave the country because he was
convicted of an aggravated felony.
In May, Democratic Gov. David Paterson of New York set up a commission to deal with
cases of green card holders who were convicted before the 1996 law kicked in or who
pleaded guilty without realizing deportation was an option.
""Congress set up this list of aggravated felonies. This was a conscious decision,"" said Ira
Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. ""This is something that
ought to be addressed in the legislature, not done by the president or Gov. Paterson
exercising their executive clemency privileges.""
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Obama has denied all pending pardon
requests. While he has yet to grant any such requests, several hundred applications
remain pending, according to Justice Department statistics.

GUADALAJARA (AP) - Public safety officials in Mexico said gunmen ambushed a convoy of 20 police officers, killing nine
of them and leaving one missing. The officials in Jalisco state said ten officers who survived the attack fought an hours-
long battle with the unknown attackers, and several gunmen were wounded. The attackers, who were riding in about
ten sport utility vehicles, were armed with grenades and assault rifles. They fled into neighboring Michoacan state after
the attack. Michoacan is the home to a violent cartel known to launch fierce attacks on police convoys.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Talks to avert a public sector strike next week which could cripple Israel's ports and airports have
been suspended and will resume after the weekend, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said on October 29. The Histadrut
labor union wants a 10.5 percent pay rise over three years for the 700,000 public sector workers it represents, but the
Finance Ministry has offered 1.5 percent. Talks will resume on October 31, the first day of the Israeli working
week. ""The gaps are still large but at least we have been able to outline (our differences). I think there is no cause for a
strike, it will harm everybody -- citizens, the economy and the workers themselves,"" Steinitz told reporters. Unions have
indicated they may call a strike as early as November 2, which could shut down public transport, government offices and
some government-owned companies. Health services and utilities would function at reduced capacity. An official with
Histadrut, which represents public sector staff, said the pay rise sought by union leaders was justified. ""We are looking
to reach a decision and gain a realistic wage rise for the workers. This is the heart of the negotiations,"" Avi Nisan-Koren
told reporters.

RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco has suspended the activities of pan-Arab Al Jazeera television on its territory, Morocco's
official MAP news agency reported on October 29, citing the Communications Ministry. The agency said the suspension
would take immediate effect and that the accreditations of the Qatar-based television station's staff in Morocco would
also be suspended. It did not give any reason for the decision.

Subject: (Reuters) Big rally by Islamic Jihad in Gaza, joined by Hamas
GAZA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of supporters of the militant Islamic Jihad movement rallied in the streets of Gaza on
October 29, chanting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel."" Young men and boys wearing white T-shirts with a
slogan in the shape of a rifle bore portraits of militants killed in combat, under the black flags of Islamic Jihad. Ramadan
Sheilah, the group's exiled chief in Damascus, sent a recorded message marking the anniversary of the assassination of
the group's leader Fathi Shiqaqi in Malta in 1995, by presumed Israeli secret agents. ""Israel will not bring peace to the
region, it will only bring war and destruction and therefore, the slogan of all should be that Israel must be wiped out of
existence,"" said Shallah, who is on a United States wanted list. Senior leaders of the ruling Islamist group, Hamas, joined
the open-air gathering, the largest for years in honor of Islamic Jihad with up to 100,000 attending according to its
organizers. Hamas allowed the group to use city terrain it usually reserves exclusively for its own rallies, and Hamas
forces provided security for the parade by its smaller rival.

Subject: (Reuters) Vietnam to award Japan nuclear plants deal
TOKYO (Reuters) - Vietnam has decided to award Japan contracts to build two of four nuclear power plants it plans to
set up by the early 2020s, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung is expected to relay the Vietnamese leadership's decision on October 31 when he and Japanese Prime
Minister Naoto Kan meet for bilateral talks at a regional summit in Hanoi, Kyodo said. Earlier this month Japan said it
had agreed with Vietnam to cooperate on nuclear power plant technologies and materials. Japan, the world's third-
biggest nuclear power generator after the United States and France, is stepping up efforts to tap the nuclear power
development market overseas. In an effort to sell its atomic technologies abroad with the help of the government, a
joint venture of 13 Japanese firms including Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was formed this
month.

Next time you feel like stepping all over your story by saying you are tired, use the line of the black woman in the
Montgomery bus boycott who walked to work: ""My feet is tired, but my soul is rested.""
On UK: Clegg held his own in the second debate last night. Gordon hit him as ""anti-American."" This feels like it's moving
to a hung parliament. Cameron can't break through. Two-thirds of the voters simply hate the Tories. No matter how well
Clegg does the system doesn't allow for any gain in seats to match his personal poll numbers. UK stunned by its first
series of debates and the whole campaign has atrophied in wonderment, little happening between the debates. Final
one next week, but guaranteed not to be conclusive, just a repetition, confirming the earlier two.

I hope that you can read this (3 pages) before your meeting with Secretary Gates on pooled funding on Monday. I have
spent a lot of time thinking about these issues in the context of the QDDR, but I think if we're going to push the position
I suggest, it has to be now. If you agree, there are a number of ways we can make this quite attractive to other agencies
as well as DoD. AM

At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
- First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
- Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a conference
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately? 1 .4(B)
2.Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?
1 .4(D)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same Bi
location as PDT.
so best that call be today.

In light of Clegg's rising popularity partly based on his anti-Americanism and Germany's growing hegemony in Europe
while becoming more insular, John Kornblum has written this op-ed with reference in last graphs to US policy.

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the
Fraulein Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived and worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic, Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany
pushed them with determination.

Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a
common currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard.
The euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s
eastward expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.
Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,
Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by
Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in
pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.
A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. ""Europe"" in the institutional sense has
become increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the
German Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate
assistance to Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a
German Tea Party?
Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the ""motor of Europe."" Ms. Merkel's
unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German
willingness to ""salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,"" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.
Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who
can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-
denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that
characterizes many E.U. programs.
Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is
whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so
sure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a
globalized world.
And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that
Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue Zuricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others
when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.
The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to
burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense
of common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will
themselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.
Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when
they rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to ""Dare to Hope,"" which is the
characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America
seems busy elsewhere.
The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a
democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to
haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for
Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.
Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be
joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness
more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will
be assured.
European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and
the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its
side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.
John Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to
Germany from 1997 to 2001.

I can't even remember now what if anything in it bugged me yesterday. Nothing in it has anyone making a double take
to flesh out so far.
Its overall frame of the partnership paints you in exactly the way I think people respect you most, and I think Hirsh might
actually have come up with a theme that will stick.
Have only seen the cover photo online, I want to see the hardcopy since we all know it's the pictures that really matter.

HANOI (AP) - A Southeast Asian official said the leaders of Japan and China have held an informal meeting at
a regional summit amid a diplomatic row that has overshadowed the gathering. Surin Pitsuwan, secretary-
general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, confirmed that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan met Saturday on the sidelines of the summit of East Asian leaders in Hanoi,
Vietnam. There had been speculation they would not meet at all because of a dispute over a maritime territorial
dispute that plunged relations to a five-year low.

Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. You will be
interviewed by one of Al's ""top"" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The interview will be in English with
simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on AJ.
Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute ""feature"" piece similar to the one for AJ Arabic. If we are
pressed for time we can consider just doing the Al Arabic feature.
Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media outlets. This is
another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a more targeted focus on
bilateral engagement and exchange programs.

TEHRAN (AP) - Iranian officials are acknowledging international sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear
program have dramatically increased the cost of living, but the penalties will ultimately prove futile. Commerce Minister
Mahdi Ghazanfari said if the sanctions were really having an impact, then the UN would not have had to impose four
sets of penalties. Chamber of Commerce President Mohammad Nahavandian did say the sanctions have driven up the
cost of imports by 30 percent.

Would like to pass on following:
Listening to translation of our more senior Chinese hosts commentary on her visit, she is clearly seen here as a figure of

Her words on regional issues, whether praising or questioning, provoke extensive commentary. Complete sentences

Dear Cheryl,
I hope all is well with you. We are all thrilled about the perception of HRC and the job she has been doing for us all.
Makes me miss my old ambassadorial days working with State.
As you can see by the below email to me, husband David Dunn (a lawyer/not lobbiest at Patton Boggs, and an old friend
of Hillary's) and another Hillary friend, Herb Miller, will be on Hainan Island on Sat. and Sun. Oct 30 and 31 (already Sat.
morning there now) to go to the city of Sanya to visit the Mayor. They are there to commit to a major commercial mall
project in Sanya with their Chinese partners, Huinong Capital.
They believe that HRC will be visiting Sanya as well in the same time frame and will meet with officials there.
They would love to say hello to HRC to show US businessmen committed to expanded US China trade relations if convenient for her
and not an interference. David can be reached at
Thanks Cheryl.

Dear Lanny,
I'm in Asia for the next ten days, so I'm copying George and asking him to read your email below and then contact you to discuss
your ideas. Thx for your concern, and thx also to George for following up w you. Hillary
souimate who, like me, agreed with every word of your speech.
""The Secretary did a SUPERP job and the audience responded with a
standing ovation. They loved her. I am grateful and relieved. We
many compliments.
Now I believe we can be helpful through the back door in breaking the stalemate.
We have an idea. Off the record - and you know I have never violated my word to you that only you know of my and efforts at
the time of the suspension of the settlements moratorium - we have an idea. But must remain back door and only becomes official
when principals propose and agree.
You said you could put me in touch with someone we both can trust to hear what we see as a way to break the stalemate.
I have two suggestions for us to talk to - old friends who know me and whom you trust:
I) Geo Mitchell - did you know Geo was my first ""boss"" in 1971 in a presidential campaign - Ed Muskies? (I was the ""national youth
coordinator"" when every ""youth"" I knew, including Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton, was for George McGovern)
2) Jim Steinberg - my buddy from my WH days.
Or whoever you suggest. We want to meet off-the-record, no one can know, to share this idea.
As to your speech - it must get wider circulation.
I am going to write about it in my Hill column next week (also appears on Huffington and Daily Caller). Can you have someone send
1 to me ASAP?)
My heart truly was tilled with gratitude and admiration for the courage you showed last night - courage because your words were
tough love equally for both sides.
Tough love for both sides.

Subject: Brief memo for Cheryl Mills on Colombia - for Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a ""great hero""
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called ""false positives"": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
""began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004."" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of ""false positives"" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
""acts of service."" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service

<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.or.g/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and ""political warfare"" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of ""what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it"" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as ""para-politics."" This
•
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly

from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a
kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu
Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday
morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were
all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local
insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth
reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures
to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a
primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death
eight school children last month. ""More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place,"" a
commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have
taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin played the eco-warrior in Russia's Arctic on Thursday, helping scientists track endangered
polar bears and calling for a cleanup of the region.
Putin traveled to Franz Josef Land, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean off the northwest coast of Russia's mainland in his
latest display of adventuring prowess to highlight the country's guardianship of the resource-rich region.

Wearing a bright red coat and cap, the 57-year-old premier kneeled at the head of a tranquilized polar bear to attach a
satellite-tracking collar, then helped elevate the beast for weighing. The images were broadcast nationally.
Putin helped measure the bear and roll it onto its side.
On his departure, he shook its paw and uttered the words: ""Be well.""
""The paw is heavy. This is the master of the Arctic, you can feel that straight away,"" Putin said.
Of a total 25,000 polar bears remaining in the wild, about 6,000 are in Russia's Arctic territory, Russian news agencies
quoted officials as saying.
Putin also called for ""a general cleanup of the Arctic,"" ordering the removal of thousands of barrels of fuel buried in the
snow that had been left unused by a Soviet-era military base.
He has been spearheading Russia's re-emergence as a regional power, including the country's claims over the Arctic's
formidable natural resources. Some 90 billion barrels of oil and one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas lie
hidden in the Arctic region, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates.
""Geopolitically, Russia's deepest interests are linked to the Arctic,"" Putin said. ""Here Russia's security and defense
capabilities is provided for. Here there are vitally important transport communications.""
Canada, the U.S., Russia and Denmark have competing claims before a United Nations commission regarding extend
their undersea boundaries into areas previously blocked by Arctic ice.
Moscow dramatically staked its claim to the region by dropping a flag on the ocean floor at the North Pole in 2007.
Since then, all four countries have agreed to cool their rhetoric and allow scientists to finish their surveys.
Putin adores the media spotlight when it accentuates his macho side. He has been photographed fishing bare-chested in
Russia's Altai region, and was shown on television diving into an icy river and swimming the butterfly stroke.
He has also tackled predators in the wild before, shooting a tiger with a tranquilizer gun and releasing leopards.

To Turkish PM Erdogan: Time to Consider all the Facts By Lanny J. Davis
http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/lanny-davis/102357-message-to-turkish-pm-erdogan
When several years ago I first met Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and had the pleasure to have two
private conversations with him, he immediately struck me as the ultimate ""purple"" leader. As The Washington Post
wrote recently, ""Erdogan's Justice and Development Party has religious roots, but it also draws conservative
entrepreneurs and liberals with its free-market policies.""
But Erdogan has recently appeared to be hostile not only to Israel, but also to the U.S. — flirting with Holocaust denier
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and undermining (apparently unintentionally) the world's efforts to prevent Iran from
developing a nuclear weapon.
Concerning the recent flotilla incident, there is no question Israel made serious mistakes in planning, intelligence and
execution and the onboard deaths were horrible and tragic. But Erdogan's harsh criticism struck many people, even
friends of Turkey, as way over the top, ignoring basic facts.
So I ask Prime Minister Erdogan, who I still believe has a good heart and wants to do the right thing, to assume that he
faced the following purely hypothetical facts as leader of his country:
Suppose for years Greek Cypriots were shooting rockets intentionally aimed at Turkish Cypriot civilians, causing many
deaths and injuries, and as a result, Turkey instituted a blockade, insisting on searching all ships for armaments;
Suppose that you learned there was a flotilla of ships leaving Greek ports destined for Greek Cyprus, called the ""Free
Turkish Cyprus"" flotilla and sponsored by a Greek organization with leaders hostile to Turkey and with associations with
an anti-Turkish terrorist organization;
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775652 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775652 Date: 08/31/2015
Suppose that after you ordered that these ships be inspected for armaments and the leaders of the ships refused, your
soldiers boarding the ships were accosted by people with pipes, iron bars and long knives, putting the Turkish soldiers in
mortal danger; and your soldiers, seeing their brothers and sisters in such danger, reacted instinctively by shooting live
ammunition, tragically killing nine people, some of whom were members of the same organization linked to an anti-
Turkish terrorist organization.
Mr. Prime Minister: If all of the above were true — and in fact, each of the above ""hypotheticals"" precisely tracks the
circumstances Israel faced — what would you and Turkey have done?
Now, you and your Turkish colleagues may argue that the big difference is that Israel is ""occupying"" the West Bank. Oh,
really? An awful lot of Greeks and much of the rest of the world believe, rightly or wrongly, that Turkey is occupying one-
half of Cyprus after a military invasion years ago. I know you and your fellow Turks feel that Turkey intervened to protect
Turk Cypriots.
A lot of Turkish Muslims somehow believe that there is religious sacrilege by Israel in ""occupying"" holy sites in East
Jerusalem and on the West Bank. Oh, really? Tens of millions of Orthodox Christians throughout Russia, Greece,
Romania and Eastern Europe would remind you that in 1453, the Turks not only occupied the holiest site in all of
Orthodox Christendom — the Holy Agia Sophia Church, which is to Orthodox Christians what St. Peter's and the Vatican
are to Roman Catholics — but also continue to this day to desecrate that site, which Turkey retains as a museum, with
the priceless religious frescoes obscenely painted over and icons smashed, and refuse to allow the restoration of Agia
Sophia to the Orthodox Church.
Compare what the Turks did to Agia Sophia to Israel's protection of the sanctity and guaranteed absolute access by
Muslims to the holy sites on the ancient Temple Mount of the al-Aqsa Mosque facing Mecca and the Dome of the Rock
ever since Israel regained control over Jerusalem in 1967. These are facts, Mr. Prime Minister. Do you deny them?
I am hoping that once you discover the entire truth about the risks to Israel's safety and security represented by these
Gaza-bound ships, and recognize that Turkey's history and role in being an occupier is not free from criticism, you will
find a way to re-engage your prior friendship and relationship with Israel, especially with regard to the peace process,
and open discussions with Israeli leaders, who I know appreciated the constructive role you have played over the years.
Even if publicly you cannot do this, I am hoping that you can privately — which would be consistent with my impression
of the man I came to know and admire after just two meetings. I can only hope and pray that you do so, and that the
world doesn't lose you as a peacemaker in the Middle East and elsewhere.

'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010
RIYADH (AFP) — An ""inept"" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on ""chasing the
terrorists"" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.
The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
• had no hope of rebuilding the country.
""What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists,"" Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama ""should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means.""
""Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
""As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries.""
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
""The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
""Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths,"" he said. ""How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775701 Date: 08/31/2015
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
""The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done,"" said Turki.
""It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.
""If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.
""He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please.""
Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
""The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work,"" he said.
For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.
""You cannot askIran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels.""
Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a ""universal nuclear security umbrella"" for the
countries in the area, and ""a good military option"" against any regional country which does not cooperate.
He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.
""Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,""
he said.
""Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?""
Turki said he hoped Obama ""will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
weapons of mass destruction.""
Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.
""Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates"" following the US pullout, he said.
Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be ""regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries,"" he warned.

H: I'm sure you are preoccupied with the adventures of Lula, et al. Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NY
Review, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. It's worth reading, not least for
Frank Luntz's poll numbers. The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly

Benjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican
pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus
criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish
community that I have ever seen.
The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. ""Six
times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,"" he
reported. ""Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the
word 'they' rather than `us' to describe the situation.""
That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of
Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at bavis, that ""non-Orthodox
younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,"" with many professing ""a near-total
absence of positive feelings."" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university
in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.

Luntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against
some firm beliefs. First, ""they reserve the right to question the Israeli position."" These young Jews, Luntz explained,
""resist anything they see as 'group think."" They want an ""open and frank"" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second,
""young Jews desperately want peace."" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled
""Proof that Israel Wants Peace,"" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land.
Third, ""some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians."" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent
and hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.
Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of
American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human
rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and
capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz
did not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish
establishment has been working against for most of their lives.
Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted
to the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted
to human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the
younger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists
are liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively
opposed—a Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens.
For several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and
now, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.
Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-
dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular
American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American
Jews can help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where
Luntz's students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.
Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew
University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, ""After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist
narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions."" One version, ""founded on a long memory of
persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in
Jewish power and solidarity."" Another, ""nourished by secularized versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment
idea of progress,"" articulates ""a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic
values."" Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the
widest on earth.
As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,
particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.
You can see this spirit in ""new historians"" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist
past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the
human rights guarantees in Israel's ""Basic Laws."" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent
willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.
But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To
understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's
worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically
cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. ""We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from
here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,"" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi
Party into Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas
""campus engagement."" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli
government's behalf. The group that organized his tour was called ""Caravan for Democracy.""
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now
banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be
called ""pre-expulsion."" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015
state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the
Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail
Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from
other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.
You don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more
you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of
expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What
they usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of
Israeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.
Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,
Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the
Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian.
In fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West
Bank, he has declared, would be a ""ghetto-state"" with ""Auschwitz borders."" And the effort ""to gouge Judea and Samaria
[the West Bank] out of Israel"" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking ""Sudeten district"" from
Czechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made
vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should
be part of the Jewish state.
On the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it
may have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-
Orthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its
Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox.
Israelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to
government subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against
territorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility
to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs ""vipers,"" ""snakes,""
and ""ants."" In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged
that ""God strike him down."" The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama ""an Islamic extremist.""
Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.
Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, ""The last time politicians
holding views similar to theirs were in power in post—World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain."" With their
blessing, ""a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal
order."" Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.
Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli
society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical
and more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone
to anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77
percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are
worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll
found that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school
students—would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the
survey ""a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.""
You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion
substantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In
Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.
(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an ""apartheid state"" if it
continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical
of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that ""Israel has not been
democratic for some time now."") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol
public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy
and yearn for peace.
The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.
On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to ""free speech and minority rights."" The Conference of Presidents
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015
declares that ""Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,
security and peace."" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve
full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything
any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very
liberal values they profess to admire.
After Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'
Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was ""far more moderate than the media has presented it.""
Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-
Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that ""He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them.""
(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence
Day evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American
Jewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would ""chill Israel's democratic political
debate."" But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline
""Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.""
Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries
to prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a
campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty
International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians ""bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic."" The Conference
of Presidents has announced that ""biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid,
[and] Save the Children."" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch ""has repeatedly
demonstrated its anti-Israel bias."" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary
Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she
had presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference
report implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'
Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors—they
leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply
defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist
visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an ""animus toward Israel,"" an
alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like
B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human
Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch.
All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics
are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?
The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say
that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe
Ya'alon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a ""virus."" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused
Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza
war. A Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which
supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an
investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NGOs.
To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own
work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's
government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in
Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.
In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal
citizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for
generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote
Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people
betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but
neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right.

These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up
to the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War,
when much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity,
often in conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life.
These Jews embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982
Lebanon war, before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped
by the culture, politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the
settlers, and Shas, American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally
cohesive, more innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.
But these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on
Israel's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they
have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than
their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption
because its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their
uncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment
is fake.
To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to
replenish their ranks. They will need to find young American Jews who have come of age during the West Bank
occupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the Orthodox
world.
Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of
the American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews
make up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In
their yeshivas they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after
high school, and often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while
only 16 percent of non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel ""very close to Israel,"" among the Orthodox the
figure is 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely
step into the breach. The Orthodox ""are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,"" explains Samuel Heilman, a
sociologist at the City University of New York. ""They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they
now control the lights.""
But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—
that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-
Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the
Orthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he
found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more
tellingly, Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had
been ill-served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the
enemy, and to deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.
Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in
the American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,
the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-
democratic veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large
Israel solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the
estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz told the rally that ""innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,"" he was booed.
America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an
American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish
population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up
among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.
In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of
houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and

'politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid
the ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.
In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he
watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on
malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli
human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant.
Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster
Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word ""Arabs, not Palestinians,"" since
""the term 'Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,"" while ""Arab' says wealth, oil and
Islam.

Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are
morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies
everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have
to do or say to make them scream ""no."" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American
universities; settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school
students want Arabs barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?
What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the
memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will
do. But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust
analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about
themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they
treated the non-Jews living under their dominion. ""For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,""
Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, ""and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how
Jews live with a minority.""
But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the
opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a
luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his
remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, ""Victimhood sets you free.""
This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply
bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from
Hezbollah and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you
possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the
dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish
victimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of
today's young American Jews as farce.
But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's
Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state ""will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and
peace taught by the Hebrew prophets,"" and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and
others to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his
party's militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which
Jewish fortunes have•radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the
ethical use of Jewish power.
For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood
of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,
from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a
permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into
the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was
the face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that
their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish
state on earth?
""Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,"" writes Avraham Burg.
""I was very comfortable there."" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral
abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an

You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be
ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political
opinions has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the us, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent
one internationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen
barred for his political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone
needs, yes, yes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of
the story. This incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the
future. This is a downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S

Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel
By ROBERT MACKEY <http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/author/robert-mackey/>
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West
Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to
deliver a lecture.
Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported <http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/noam-chomsky-denied-
entry-into-israel-and-west-bank-1.290701> :
No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby
Bridge border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit
Israel. Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank
on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters
<http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64F23H20100516> that there had been a misunderstanding and ""officials
were trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to
enter.""
In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, ""the facts
were completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding."" He explained that he was interrogated

for several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-
year-old scholar added:
I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he
was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was
that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an
invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past
but not this time.
Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at
the Palestinian university in Ramallah <http://www.birzeit.edu/news/21160/news> .
The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza
<http://web.mit.edu/cis/eventposter_011309_chomsky.html> , which ended in January 2009 and has criticized Israel's
occupation of Palestinian territory many times.
In an interview <http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/magazine/way-we-live-now-11-02-03-questions-for-noam-
chomsky-professorial-provocateur.html> with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr.
Chcimsky said, ""I objected to the founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is
a proper concept. I would object to the United States as a Christian state."" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on
his opposition to Israel, saying, ""Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating
Jew,"" he replied:
It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian
criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?

The below by Kouchner is worth reading if you haven't seen it.
The Internet: a critical international policy issue, by Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010)
In 2015, three and a half billion people - half of mankind - will have access to the Internet. There has never been such a
revolution in the freedom of communication and the freedom of expression. But how will this new medium be used?
What new distortions and obstacles will the enemies of the Internet come up with?
Modern technology leads to the best and the worst. Extremist, racist and defamatory websites and blogs disseminate
odious opinions in real time. They have made the Internet into a weapon of war and hate. Websites are attacked and
Internet users are recruited through chatrooms for destructive plots. Violent movements are infiltrating social networks
to spread propaganda and false information.
It is very hard for democracies to control them. I do not subscribe to the naïve belief that a new technology, however
efficient and powerful it may be, is bound by nature to advance liberty on all fronts.
Yet, all the same, the distortions are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic
means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who
have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides
power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated

worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult the hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of
human rights.
In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil
society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.
However, the temptation to repress free expression is always present. The number of countries that censor the Internet,
that monitor web users and punish them for their opinions, is increasing at an alarming rate. The Internet can be used
against citizens. It can be a formidable intelligence-gathering tool to spot potential dissidents. Some regimes are already
acquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.
If all of those who are attached to human rights and democracy refused to compromise their principles and used the
Internet to defend freedom of expression, this kind of repression would be much more difficult. I am not talking about
absolute freedom that opens the door to all sorts of abuses. Nobody is promoting that. Instead, I'm talking about real
freedom, which is based on the principle of respecting human dignity and human rights.
In the last few years, multilateral institutions, such as the Council of Europe, and non-governmental organisations, such
as Reporters Without Borders, along with thousands of individuals around the world, have made a strong commitment
to these issues. This is proof, if proof were needed, that this issue does not pit the West against the rest of the world. No
fewer than 180 countries meeting for the World Summit on the Information Society acknowledged that the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights applies fully to the Internet, especially Article 19, which establishes freedom of expression
and freedom of opinion. And yet, some fifty countries fail to live up to their commitments.
For the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I have brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists, business
people and intellectuals this week. Their discussions have confirmed my conviction that the path we want to take is the
right one. I think that we should create an international instrument for monitoring the commitments that governments
have made and for calling them to task when they fail to live up to them. I think we should provide assistance to
cyberdissidents, who should get the same support as other victims of political repression, and of the need to show our
solidarity with them publicly, in close collaboration with the NGOs working on these issues. I think that we should also
discuss the wisdom of adopting a code of conduct regarding the export of technologies for censoring the Internet and
tracking web users.
These issues, along with others, such as the protection of personal data on the Internet and the right of digital amnesty
for everyone promoted by my colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, should be addressed within a framework that
brings together government, civil society and international experts.
Another project is close to my heart. It will be a long and difficult task to implement it, but it is critical. It is to give the
Internet a legal status that reflects its universality. One that recognizes it as an international space, so that it will be
more difficult for repressive governments to use the sovereignty argument against fundamental freedoms.
This is a critical issue. I think that the battle of ideas has started with, on one side, the advocates of a universal and open
Internet, based on freedom of expression and freedom of association, on tolerance and respect for privacy and, on the
other side, those who want to transform the Internet into a multitude of spaces that are closed off from each other to
serve the purposes of a regime, propaganda and all forms of fanaticism.
Freedom of expression is ""the foundation of all other freedoms"". Without it, there are no ""free nations"", Voltaire said.
This spirit of the Enlightenment, which is universal, should run through the new media. The defence of fundamental
freedoms and human rights must be the priority for governance of the Internet. It is everyone's business.

Subject: Mexican treatment of the undocumented
FYI, from WHA:
Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like SB1070,
officials in the course of official ""contact"" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized to request proof
of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred
to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants,
primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights
groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.

Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,
For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.
The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.

You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:
http://www.ted.com/talks/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html
The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor
of Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but
is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.
In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable
tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indonesia is the world's #4
greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to
rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of
this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many
others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,
with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.
To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage
match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For
every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square
miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for
compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,
social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.
It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the
political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth
consideration.
The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric
Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono,
the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at or on cell at
Pacific Time Zone.

For your reading pleasure on the way home, S/P has been working on a project that I discussed with Jake a while back --
aimed at figuring out where we could do better and above all create more leverage to achieve our goals. The papers are
blunter than anything you would see from the bureaus -- they should not necessarily be read as policy blueprints but
rather as illustrations of alternative strategies. We have made sure that the special assistants have them on the plane. I
will also share the individual papers with the relevant assistant secretaries. We will then be happy to take the project
further if you approve.
You will be happy to know that rain has stopped at the Expo!

HRC: Below is ah oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook.
Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.
Best, Sandy
By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs

administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. ""At no time in human history,"" he said, ""has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy.""
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates.""
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against aI-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.

Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.

Graduation Ceremony for Academy kids is Friday, June 11th, at 630pm. At our Shaw Campus. 1851 9th Street, NW
You might want to let the Secretary know that is going to be the graduation speaker. My guess is she B6
can't come, but maybe she'd want to drop him a note. If so, let me know, I'll draft something for.

Subject: H: Several observations on the Israeli raid. Sid
First observation: Bibi's Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu; 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and
denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.
Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately
seeks his father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of
his son Bibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on
Entebbe, except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then,
there's Ehud Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film,
Munich. Ultimately, it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to
have escaped the participants.) Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama
administration gave a wink or nod as the Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.
Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the
analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the
Israelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?
Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace
process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any
circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think
so.
Cheers,
Sid
Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son Not Serious About Two-State Solution.

In a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzion_Netanyahu> Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state.
The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the
Palestinians.
Here are excerpts from the interview <http://www.mako.co.il/news-military/politics/Article-

""He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I heard
from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not one of them.""
When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:
Herzl <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl> and Nordau <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Nordau>
(fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is Jewish land and not a land for the
Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the
conditions.

Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in Entebbe Rescue
by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu
Follow Israel news on Twitter <http://twitter.com/IsraelNewsStory> and Facebook
<http://www.facebook.com/pages/IsraelNationalNews/102510354100> .
On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe <http://www.yoni.org.il/en/jonathan.php>, Uganda in 1976.
<http://info.a7.org/php_en/c.php?b=1816&z=17&clientid=1352&dest=http://www.bneiaish.com>
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance
Day for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery
Sunday night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF
carved into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One
of his less known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of
Memorial Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims
<http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137050> of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-
establishment of the State of Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948
War for Independence, when seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the
Holocaust ended.
On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com)

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/32038200/Maariv-May27-10-Netanyahu-Says-He-Beat-Obama> and at bottom of post] In
the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel
between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make
concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said
Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to
expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the
administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,
and the Americans will ""make sure"" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take
""aggressive"" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the
settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. ""The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect,"" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. ""They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The
reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the
commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace
process in our region.""
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week
might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the
planned meeting as ""the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama
administration in the past number of weeks."" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave
crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that
was received as if Israel was ""no longer an absolute ally of the United States.""
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire
among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to °
end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. ""The Democratic Party's coffers
are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to
continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,"" said one source in
Washington.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776099 Date: 08/31/2015
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two
months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture
taken together and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that ""Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap
once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very
difficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.""
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's
acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his
movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

USUN PRESS RELEASE #109 May 31, 2010
AS DELIVERED
Remarks by Ambassador Alejandro Wolff, Deputy Permanent U.S. Representative to the United Nations, at an
Emergency Session of the Security Council, May 31, 2010
Thank you, Mr. President and thank you, Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco.
The United States is deeply disturbed by the recent violence and regrets the tragic loss of life and injuries suffered
among those involved in the incident last night aboard the Gaza-bound ships. We are working to ascertain the facts.
We expect a credible and transparent investigation and strongly urge the Israeli government to investigate the incident
fully.
As I stated in the Chamber in December 2008, when we were confronted by a similar situation, mechanisms exist for the
transfer of humanitarian assistance to Gaza by member states and groups that want to do so. These non-provocative
and non-confrontational mechanisms should be the ones used for the benefit of all those in Gaza. Direct delivery by sea
is neither appropriate nor responsible, and certainly not effective, under the circumstances.
The United States remains deeply concerned by the suffering of civilians in Gaza, and the deterioration of the situation
there, including the humanitarian and human rights situation. We continue to believe the situation is unsustainable and
is not in the interests of any of those concerned. We will continue to engage the Israelis on a daily basis to expand the
scope and type of goods allowed into Gaza to address the full range of the population's humanitarian and recovery
needs. Hamas' interference with international assistance shipments and the work of nongovernmental organizations
complicates efforts in Gaza. Its continued arms smuggling and commitment to terrorism undermines security and
prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike.
We will continue to work closely with the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, along with international
NGOs and the UN, to provide adequate access for humanitarian goods, including reconstruction materials, through the
border crossings, while bearing in mind the Government of Israel's legitimate security concerns.
Ultimately, this incident underscores the need to move ahead quickly with negotiations that can lead to a
comprehensive peace in the region. The only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement,
negotiated between the parties, that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and fulfills the aspirations of both parties
for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous, and viable state

MOSCOW (Reuters) — Prime Minister Putin told CNN television that Russia will deploy nuclear weapons and ""strike
forces"" if it is shut out of a Western missile defense system, echoing a warning from President Medvedev. In an interview
with Larry King, Putin said missile threats against Europe must be tackled jointly -- a reference to an agreement reached
at a Russia-NATO summit this month to cooperate on missile defense. But if Russia's proposals are rejected and new
threats appear along its borders, ""Russia will have to ensure its own security,"" Putin said. Russia would ""put in place new
strike forces.. .against the new threats which will have been created along our borders,"" Putin said. ""New missile, nuclear
technologies will be put in place."" Putin said Russia does not want this to happen and is not threatening the West, but the
remarks underscored the Kremlin's insistence on a significant role in a missile defense system and suggested ties could
sour badly if agreement is not reached.

KABUL (Reuters) — Afghanistan announced on December 1 the final batch of results from a September 18 parliamentary
election, with poll organizers aiming to wrap up a vote marred by widespread fraud and pave the way for a new
parliament. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said preliminary winners would hold their seats in southeastern
Ghazni province. Election officials released results for Afghanistan's other 33 provinces and for Kuchi nomads a week
ago but delayed Ghazni because of technical issues and irregularities.

Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,
For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.
The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.
You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776222 Date: 08/31/2015
The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor
of Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but
is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.
In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable
tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indo'nesia is the world's #4
greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to
rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of
this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many
others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,
with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.
To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage
match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For
every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square
miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for
compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,
social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.
It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the
political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth
consideration.
The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric
Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono,
the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at or on cell at
Pacific Time Zone.

Subject: (Reuters) Hamas would honor referendum on peace with Israel
GAZA (Reuters) - The Islamist Hamas movement, whose charter advocates the elimination of Israel, would accept the
outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a future peace treaty with the Jewish state, its Gaza leader said on December 1.
Ismail Haniyeh, addressing a rare news conference in the Israeli-blockaded enclave, signaled a softening of Hamas's
long-standing position prohibiting the ceding of any part of the land of what was British-mandated Palestine until 1948.
""We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian
prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees,"" Haniyeh said, referring to the year of Middle East war in which
Israel captured East Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories.
""Hamas will respect the results (of a referendum) regardless of whether it differs with its ideology and principles,"" he
said, provided it included all Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and the diaspora.
The Hamas charter, drafted in 1988, regards all of the land of Palestine, including what is now Israel, as the heritage
of Muslims. The idea of a referendum on a future peace accord with Israel was rejected by some Hamas leaders when it
was proposed by Palestinian President Abbas several months ago.

solve difficult international problems, telling the truth and diplomats acting professionally.
Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie
H. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies
and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he
toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and
he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did
Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the
hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless
left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to
come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out
and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.
These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial
world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.
His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really
doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was
plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—
The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president is
a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for
serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie
H. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies
and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he
toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and
he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did
Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the
hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless
left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to
come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out
and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.
These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial
world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.
His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really
doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was
plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—
The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president is
a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.

—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for
serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

Our first calling, in politics, is to protect, honor and leave better our American system...
If we tear down the American political process by doing and saying anything to win then we have failed that calling
before we ever begin...
The campaign cycle of 2010 has had a tumultuous start. Tea Party libertarians screaming from street corners, unhappy
workers taking on incumbents, disgruntled faithful praying that the administration will keep its promises, Birthers
repelling from black helicopters into the American mainstream and town hall meetings resembling Three Stooges re-

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's opposition Muslim Brotherhood, which held a fifth of seats in the outgoing parliament, has
pulled out of an election race after winning no seats in the first round, al-Arabiya television reported.
The group, which runs candidates as independents to skirt a ban on religious parties, said the vote was rigged in favor
of President Mubarak's ruling party.
Al-Arabiya said the group was pulling out of a run-off to be held on December 5. The group said 26 of its candidates
had made it through to the run-off. A senior Brotherhood official told Reuters an announcement would be made later
on December 1.

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible he is more flexible on place and times than his mother! Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

Hillary, as promised, I connected with Bruce Jones at NYU about Spanta. Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta put
together an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzai
whether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying he's decided to stay on
a bit longer. That said, he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it
sounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now. Bruce, Martin and I will be open to other NY/DC
possibilities down the road when Spanta's situation changes. Thanks again for the truly terrific event at Brookings.

Wikileaks Accidentally Helps U.S.

November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
**Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how
he inadvertently proved the opposite.**
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked-but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on
allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.

Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did
he toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention,
and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial.
Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not
by the hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it-and for the attention. Anyone who is not a
hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some
time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant
went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world
problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies. His aim,
he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really doing.
Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was plain: that
our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
-Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
-The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
-Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to diminish
the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president is a
harmless way to get a critical job done-that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
-No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.

The Republican case for ratifying New START
bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews
By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell
Thursday, December 2, 2010;
Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That
is why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and
START II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognized
that reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclear
catastrophe and increase the stability of America's relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the Russian
Federation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.
As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expired
almost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the United
States to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit.
Along with our obligation to protect the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to allies around the
world. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty are
sufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by a
Republican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense.
We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the
administration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as
previous nuclear arms treaties did.
Although each of us had initial questions about New START, administration officials have provided reasonable
answers. We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification.
First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since
the original START expired last December, Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes
in its strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day,
America's understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded, and resources have been diverted from national
security tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into
Russia's activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent
mission.
Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our military
commanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although
the treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic
missiles, our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than
building new ones for defense purposes.
Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to
maintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification
process. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Department's
nuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originally
proposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in
this effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that
our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond.
Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not
from Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall
into the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why an arms control treaty with Russia
matters. It matters because it is in both parties' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic
nuclear relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in
rolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work to
secure ""loose nukes"" in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in
Afghanistan, a breeding ground for international terrorism.
Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be
considered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest, and we should
consider the ramifications of not ratifying it.
Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage all senators to focus on national security. There
are plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy.
With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb, we anticipate
significant conflict between Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national interest to ratify New
START.

Scott Horton has just returned from a week in Kyrgyzstan, where he held lengthy private conversations with a range of
leaders. He has sent me his confidential report. In light of the crisis there—the pogroms that have created perhaps as
many as 450,000 refugees, according to the U.N.—and on the eve of the June 27 constitutional referendum—he
explains why and how this is an opportunity for joint U.S.-Russian action and other U.S. initiatives. His policy

Subj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan
I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1– 6, during which time I met with almost all the members of the interim government,
with special focus on foreign relations, security and legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015
1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh, I found that the interim
government fully expected violence to break out there but did not anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly
acknowledged that the government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was extremely
tenuous. They said they had severe ""loyalty"" problems with key figures in the police and military. When I pressed on
what they meant by ""loyalty,"" I was told that the Bakiyev family had ""its people"" in key positions in the police and army
and that they had intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security officers in the
south. ""Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum,"" I was told. Beknazarov told me he believed that,
following the pattern of the last two revolutions, they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative
offices in the south, following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke with over the
weekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to
instigate inter-ethnic violence.
Precisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful investigation, but people I have
spoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of
these individuals as persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific descriptions of events
support this thesis—Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then
Bakiyev adopted an extremely cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the
referendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an iron-fisted central government
through the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevic
and Radovan Kara&'id as Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire in
programs like ""Operation Koltso."" If the government's charges bear out, serious crimes were committed by the Bakiyev
faction.
While Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that foreign intervention is no longer
needed, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her
government and its abilities. Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in
the south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily count on the local police and
military there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in turn suggests that the international community should give
active consideration to both the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense
remains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.
2. Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on being completely dysfunctional. It
operates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage
appointments. Career civil service personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days
inside the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly observe primitive horse-
trading, threats and counterthreats between key government functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza
Otunbayeva and a handful of figures closest to her were exceptions in this process—admonishing others about the
unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and restraint. But Otunbayeva also acknowledges that the limitations
on her own authority and states that she ""has to put up with it,"" at least for the moment. Three government members
advised me during meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running for
parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the government—between Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance,
who could not refrain from criticizing one another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.
Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the glue that holds things
together, commanding the respect of the other government members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was
almost universal—she appears to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an
untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as ""president of the interim
government"" presents some clear problems for her authority. She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no
democratic mandate. After the new government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have
democratic legitimacy and she will not—this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be eclipsed or at least
made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government recognize that she has essential skills that they do
not—particularly her ability to conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015
There is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the government. The next
government is expected to be formed through a parliamentary coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current
seven factions will survive. Much of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game
of parliamentary moving chairs—there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty and funds to use in the
parliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of
parliamentary elections and the sense that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and
near chaotic appearance of the current government.
3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government put forward a proposed new
constitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift
the country further in the direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for parliamentary
minority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the
question of the constitution directly, pressing them to retain a ""strong president"" system. They say this was coupled
with not-very-subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed, with harmful
consequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about holding the referendum as scheduled. The events
in the south have resulted in the mass displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population
in the south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their current problems all come
back to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a government with democratic legitimacy without a new
constitution and new elections. Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date
of the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October 10). The crisis in the south
presents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if
indeed he did.
4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is deeply fragmented on the question
of MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a ""pragmatic solution"" to the base issue under which it will be
continued but placed on a more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.
Otunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it presents no friction for Kyrgyz-
Russian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United
States and Russia. Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing the base and
seeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the clear impression that his attitudes were
entirely opportunistic—he thinks this will be a good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly
that he could accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats to close the
base as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov
strikes me as hot-headed and crass and an untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has
somewhat demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and most senior member
of the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of reason in the process. My impression based on
discussions with numerous figures is that Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government
members are agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and that the base must
rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more under-the-table dealings with political figures.
5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in mind when approaching the
humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power.
The interim government's legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak tools
to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must involve the creation of governments at
the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh, Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy.
Delaying this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This highlights the need to
conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible. Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a
""Sophie's choice"" between the United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint
U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely participation). With President Medvedev's
visit to the White House now on the horizon, this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an
international humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that could achieve U.S.-
Russian co-sponsorship:

• An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz
agitators, including a number in uniform and operating military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed
groups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted (rapes etc.)
by another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political manipulation (including payment of money to
drug and other criminal gangs) aimed at fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek
drug baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also suggests that criminal gangs
involved in drug transshipment had another motivation for engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an
initiative of the deposed president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling and
criminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate and martial law rules including
curfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim government. An imprimatur of support from the international
community would help establish the authority of the interim government in this process.
• Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to leave the high risk zones, and access
of humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to
shelter them. The EU, OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the southern
regions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable distribution of humanitarian aid among
those in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek government may be particularly important in this process.
• Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support special arrangements with broad
international legitimacy and participation to enhance peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I
noted, even though Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police
intervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her confidential discussions Otunbayeva
acknowledges the benefits in confidence building that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international
presence in the region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for designated
sheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring operations in tandem with local police and
military, to build confidence in their protective functions.
• Investigation of Events: a broad, credible, independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and
their origin. The investigation should be under the aegis of an international organization, such as the Security Council or
OSCE and it should be conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and prosecutor. The
investigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that crimes against humanity were perpetrated,
potentially including crimes of genocide. The involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authority—
policemen, military figures, leaders of the civil administration—should be given special scrutiny in this process. The
person commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically empowered to recommend criminal charges be
brought against individuals identified in his investigation—either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or
before an international body seized of proper jurisdiction.
• Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as many as 450,000 persons may have
been displaced by the current violence. The devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near
total. There will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and healthcare. The
international community under United States and Russian leadership should provide generous support to jumpstart the
reconstruction process, prioritizing its assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.
• The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view of the disruption and violence, the interim government may
well conclude that the constitutional referendum must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum,
then extraordinary measures should be taken to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are given an
opportunity to vote—in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the
democratic process that will be critical to the resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize
observers in connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair access to the ballot
and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair
and free manner across the country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure
that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable limitations in the process.

Re: Kyrgyzstan crisis, report and recommendations
Scott Horton has just returned from a week in Kyrgyzstan, where he held lengthy private
conversations with a range of leaders. He has sent me his confidential report. In light of
the crisis there—the pogroms that have created perhaps as many as 450,000 refugees,
according to the U.N.—and on the eve of the June 27 constitutional referendum—he
explains. why and how this is an opportunity for joint U.S.-Russian action and other U.S.
initiatives. His policy recommendations follow his report.

Subj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan
I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1– 6, during which time I met with almost all the
members of the interim government, with special focus on foreign relations, security and
legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:
1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh,
I found that the interim government fully expected violence to break out there but did not
anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly acknowledged that the
government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was
extremely tenuous. They said they had severe ""loyalty"" problems with key figures in the
police and military. When I pressed on what they meant by ""loyalty,"" I was told that the
Bakiyev family had ""its people"" in key positions in the police and army and that they had
intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security
officers in the south. ""Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum,"" I was told.
Beknazarov told me he believed that, following the pattern of the last two revolutions,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative offices in the south,
following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke
with over the weekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they
had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to instigate inter-ethnic violence.
Precisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful
investigation, but people I have spoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders
directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of these individuals as
persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific
descriptions of events support this thesis—Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had
something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then Bakiyev adopted an extremely
cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the
referendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an
iron-fisted central government through the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics
used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevia and Radovan Karathle as
Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire
in programs like ""Operation Koltso."" If the government's charges bear out, serious
crimes were committed by the Bakiyev faction.
While Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that
foreign intervention is no longer needed, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually
thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her government and its abilities.
Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in
the south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily
count on the local police and military there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in
turn suggests that the international community should give active consideration to both
the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense
remains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.
2. Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on
being completely dysfunctional. It operates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with
leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage appointments. Career civil service
personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days inside
the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly
observe primitive horse-trading, threats and counterthreats between key government
functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza Otunbayeva and a handful of figures
closest to her were exceptions in this process—admonishing others about the
unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and. restraint. But Otunbayeva also
acknowledges that the limitations on her own authority and states that she ""has to put up
with it,"" at least for the moment. Three government members advised me during
meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running
for parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the government—between
Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance, who could not refrain from criticizing one
another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the
glue that holds things together, commanding the respect of the other government
members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was almost universal—she appears
to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an
untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as
""president of the interim government"" presents some clear problems for her authority.
She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no democratic mandate. After the new
government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have democratic
legitimacy and she will not—this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be
eclipsed or at least made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government
recognize that she has essential skills that they do not—particularly her ability to
conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.
There is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the
government. The next government is expected to be formed through a parliamentary
coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current seven factions will survive. Much
of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game of
parliamentary moving chairs—there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty
and funds to use in the parliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or
swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of parliamentary elections and the sense
that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and near
chaotic appearance of the current government.
3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government
put forward a proposed new constitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a
referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift the country further in the
direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for
parliamentary minority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president
Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the question of the constitution directly, pressing
them to retain a ""strong president"" system. They say this was coupled with not-very-
subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed,
with harmful consequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about
holding the referendum as scheduled. The events in the south have resulted in the mass
displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population in the
south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their
current problems all come back to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a
government with democratic legitimacy without a new constitution and new elections.
Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date
of the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October
10). The crisis in the south presents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that
this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if indeed he did.
4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is
deeply fragmented on the question of MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a
""pragmatic solution"" to the base issue under which it will be continued but placed on a
more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
Otunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it
presents no friction for Kyrgyz-Russian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding
fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United States and Russia.
Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing
the base and seeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the
clear impression that his attitudes were entirely opportunistic—he thinks this will be a
good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly that he could
accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats
to close the base as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions
from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov strikes me as hot-headed and crass and an
untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has somewhat
demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and
most senior member of the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of
reason in the process. My impression based on discussions with numerous figures is that
Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government members are
agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and
that the base must rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more
under-the-table dealings with political figures.
5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in
mind when approaching the humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the
crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power. The interim government's
legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak
tools to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must
involve the creation of governments at the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh,
Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy. Delaying
this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This
highlights the need to conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible.
Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a ""Sophie's choice"" between the
United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint
U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely
participation). With President Medvedev's visit to the White House now on the horizon,
this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an international
humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that
could achieve U.S.-Russian co-sponsorship:
An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly
to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz agitators, including a number in uniform and operating
military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed groups are involved in
random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted
(rapes etc.) by another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political
manipulation (including payment of money to drug and other criminal gangs) aimed at
fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek drug
baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also
suggests that criminal gangs involved in drug transshipment had another motivation for
engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an initiative of the deposed

president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling
and criminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate
and martial law rules including curfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim
government. An imprimatur of support from the international community would help

Subject: (AP) Palestinians angered over new Israeli construction
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is moving ahead with a plan for 625 new homes in east Jerusalem, angering Palestinians as
peace talks remain stuck over settlement construction. The plan received preliminary approval from a district planning
committee, which published an announcement on November 25. Further approval is required and construction will not
begin for about two years. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said December 2 the move showed Israel had chosen
""settlements and not peace."" The units are slated for Pisgat Zeev. While Israelis consider it a neighborhood of their
capital, the Palestinians see it as a settlement.

Spoke to both Condi Rice and Jim Baker this afternoon re START op-ed. Condi said she plans her own op-ed, arguing in
favor of treaty ratification, due out in next few days. She asked that I tell the Secretary again that she'll be supportive.
Baker said he agreed that things were breaking the right way on the Hill, and shared the view that ratification before the
holidays is an increasing possibility. He was glad to have done the op-ed (even while complaining mildly about how
much effort it took to ""herd the cats"" to get it out), and hopeful of its effect.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Charles Rangel of New York has been censured by the House for financial and fundraising
misconduct.
The vote December 2 was 333-79. It was only the 23rd time that the House invoked its most serious punishment
short of expulsion.
The solemn procedure calls for Rangel to appear at the front of the chamber while Speaker Nancy Pelosi reads the
censure resolution.
The 80-year-old Democrat has served in the House for 40 years.

Special Report
WikiLeaks
17:00; 12/2/10
Media coverage in many countries of WikiLeaks releases is decreasing, with new stories from wire services on
Assanage and Interpol and the latest Russia reports. Reporting on specific cables is shifting to more local
issues, such as US military use of Ireland's Shannon Airport or US interest in Iran's activities in
Peru. Governments and many commentators assert US relationships will not be significantly damages, and
there are frequent observations that the releases have not revealed ""anything new."" Anti-US writers and media
continue to use the opportunity to skewer the United States.
Many of the items below are digests of more extensive Embassy reporting. Additional reporting is available
from post email submissions.
AF:
Burundi
Swahili Bonesha FM radio broadcast a report that a Spanish official told Embassy Madrid that Russia, Belarus,
and Chechnya had become a mafia states, and also mentioned anti-terrorism expert Russell Travers would
investigate the leak. The story suggested the leaks have embarrassed US diplomats.
Mali
No local mention in print or broadcast media in Mali.
Niger
No local media coverage.
Zimbabwe
An online website reports Zimbabwean political parties in a fragile coalition government on Tuesday dismissed
WikiLeaks revelations that a power sharing deal between them is doomed because of acute differences between
rival politicians.

Most local newspapers carry wire reports on Assange's legal situation. Dailies also cited Assange calling for
Secretary Clinton to if it's proved she ordered American diplomats to spy on U.N. officials. Local dailies focus
on Iran's President Ahmadinejad saying ""the documents lack the legality and the credibility and they will not
affect on Iran's relations with other countries in the region."" Dailies also focused on one alleged report that
Syrian President Al-Asad's ""is not convinced Iran is developing nuclear weapons."" There is no mention of the
Jordan-specific leaks in any print media.
A columnist writing for Al-Ghad contends the leaks will not harm the region or the US, although they could
undermine trust. He sates the documents show that the positions of the US and Middle Eastern states on
regional issues is clear. Another columnist writing for the same paper catalogues criticisms of international
leaders and concludes by wondering ""what will happen next.""
EIJR:
Azerbaijan
The only Azerbaijan-specific newspaper reporting is an article in opposition daily Yeni Musavat containing a
denial by the Bank of Baku of an allegation that it is involved in Iran's sanction-busting. Wide coverage of a
document comparing President Aliyev to both Sonny and Michael Corleone in the online news websites. TV
maintains tone that Wikileaks is criminal conspiracy and that the documents are inaccurate.
Finland
Coverage continues, but much reduced. Focus has shifted to the refusal of Finnish authorities, notably
President Halonen and FM Stubb, to comment on revelations about Finland that have emerged from the leaks.
Much speculation has focused on suggestions in the leaked documents that China had pressured Finland not to
accept Uigur prisoners being released by the U.S. from Guantanamo Bay. Finnish officials continue to assert
publicly that the leaks will not affect relations with the United States. It was also reported that Finland has no
plans to reassess its own policy on confidentiality. Commentary speculates about what may be revealed in the
future, but expects little damage to relations.
Germany
Coverage is still primarily focused on the domestic impact of the leaks, particularly on the hunt for the young
politician who allegedly provided the U.S. Embassy with confidential government documents. Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung and Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in a joint editorial that ""those in Germany who thought
North Korea was a dark empire but not a real threat have been proven wrong by the WikiLeaks revelations.""
Der Spiegel is continuing to publish new material on roughly the same timeline and topics as the New York
Times; today's coverage focused on Russia and was substantively the same as the English-language reporting
over the past few days.
Ireland
Media is focusing on specific revelations about the use of Shannon Airport by the U.S. military. According to
the Irish Daily Mirror ""it appears the (Irish) government was not serious about dealing with real concerns about
the use of Shannon by the U.S. military on their way to Iraq and Afghanistan. Bloggers opine the Irish
government felt conflicted — it liked the revenue it received from U.S. troops passing through, as well as the
diplomatic benefits, but felt it had to placate the Irish public before the 2007 elections and publicly decry the
use of Shannon. The Irish Examiner relied on an excerpt from TIME Magazine's interview with Assange. An
analyst writing for the Irish Independent headlines ""Diplomatic corps' horror is pure gold for historians,""
concluding that, ith 900 further Irish cables set to be published in the coming months, the trouble may only be
starting for the mandarins of Iveagh House (Department of Foreign Affairs).""
Malta
Interest in Wikileaks continues in the online media, with comments on the more general revelations. There
were no new pieces about Malta itself.

Montenegro
Over the course of the last two days, the Wikileaks story has moved from the cover pages and headlines of
Montenegro's media to the international news sections. All major electronic and print media carried the first
official statement of a Montenegrin official on the topic. PM Djukanovic said American diplomats were doing
their job and nothing can spoil the US-Montenegran relationship. There was wire coverage of the Interpol
warrant and Secretary Clinton at the OSCE.
Portugal
Calling it ""an Invaluable Service to Democracy, a columnist for Niblico condemns ""the orders that American
diplomats received to collect personal information from high-ranking international officials, and in particular,
Ban Ki-Moon's."" He concludes that ""The future of freedom is linked to the security and integrity of our
personal data — and I do not know that the U.S., after having lost 250,000 of its secret documents, is in any
condition to guarantee either one of them.""
Switzerland:
Swiss press reports feature extensive coverage; however, very little new information. Items reported included
preparations for a Clinton meeting with Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey in 2009; the Swiss - Libya
affair; FBI-Swiss Federal Police liaison in 2006; Papers also reported that Julian Assange has contacts in
Switzerland and that a Swiss citizen from Basel is allegedly in charge of processing donations for
Wikileaks. According to the press, Assange met representatives of the Swiss Pirate Party in Geneva. Finally,
Swiss papers took up the story that Wikileaks might be targeting Bank of America, writing that the bank is
trying to calm down the stock markets. The NZZ published two opinion pieces. Both critical of the leaks for the
harm they do to diplomacy.
WHA:
Brazil
Brazilian media today featured extensive coverage. Folha de Sao Paulo dedicated six pages, including an op-ed
by Ambassador Shannon outlining the U.S. viewpoint. Folha's editorial said the information released is
relevant but neither surprising nor dangerous, while another outlet praised efforts by certain papers to filter the
information and adding that Wikileaks is on the whole valuable to society. A commentator in Folha wrote that
President Lula should not so quickly dismiss the U.S. observations about the GoB (which he claimed are likely
accurate), and another used the documents' description of President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin to
analyze the possible role of Lula in the Rousseff Administration.
Cuba
Cuban media coverage continues at levels similar to yesterday's. Online Cubadebate and Juventudrebelde.cu
publish wide-ranging articles, many of them culled from news wires, covering USG reaction, third country
reaction (Canada), and Wikileaks reaction (Julian Assange's ""insurance"" against prosecution and accusations
that Amazon violated the First Amendment). In commentary, Granma's Manuel E. Yepe, a Cuban lawyer,
economist, journalist and former Cuban ambassador to Romania, suggests that Wikileaks ""yielded to pressure
from the USG and the media in managing how and when information was released, and insinuates that right
wing elements in the U.S. are behind the disclosure of the documents.
Eastern Caribbean:
Reporting continues to be general, with the exception of one radio report on StarCom's LOVE FM 104.1 that
WikiLeaks may soon release cables about the Caribbean, and mentioning that the U.S. Embassy in Port of Spain
released a statement that WikiLeaks' actions jeopardize the U.S. national security.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776619 Date: 08/31/2015
Discussion continues to dominate the front pages of major newspapers as well as the editorial pages--with an
increase in the number of opinion articles. Press continues to report and opine on the invitation to Ecuador
offered by Deputy Foreign Minister Kintto Lucas to Assange and the subsequent disclaimer and withdrawal of
the invitation by President Correa. Most articles criticized Lucas for his error. A tongue-in-cheek editorial in El
Universo ""The Coming of Julian"" expressed regrets that Assange would not be coming to Ecuador as he might
have revealed the secrets of the GOE and then would have faced the same or worse treatment that Ecuadorian
investigative journalists receive.
El Salvador
A columnist for El Diario de Hoy asked ""What is the big deal?"" He said the cables about Honduras ""tell us
that the American diplomats were lost and did not understand what was happening"" during the coup
there. Any Ambassador who is not reporting on the mental state of people like Hugo Chavez, Daniel Ortega,
Evo Morales and Cristina Kirchner, is not doing his job ... This is all so routine that it cannot greatly affect
American diplomacy ..."" Salvadoran media reporting continues to rely almost exclusively on wire
stories. Locally produced articles and TV/radio reports have focused on reaction from Foreign Minister
Martinez and Ambassador Aponte, both of whom have repeatedly explained the nature of diplomatic
correspondence and have underscored the strength of the US-Salvadoran bilateral relationship.
Honduras
The buzz around the WikiLeaks scandal is slowly taking a backseat — for now -- to Honduran issues such as
taxes and security issues. Conservative Tribuna had a positive editorial arguing countries maintain relations
with each other based on national interest. It suggested ""the importance of the U.S. on the global stage will
ensure that other countries will continue to work closely with Washington in the pursuit of those interests."" An
op-ed in liberal daily Tiempo titled ""In defense of Ambassador Hugo Llorens,"" stressed that diplomats must
provide honest advice to their government. Tiempo's op-ed claims that ""the documents divulged so far
havebeen, in their majority, frivolities without importance, however highly sensitive and dangerous issues could
pop up in them...[d]iplomacy is a prolonged example of hypocrisy and cynicism.""
Mexico
El Universal in its editorial questions the wholesale, unfiltered dumping of classified information; ""the fact that
a government hides something does not make it damnable. It's normal.. .for diplomats to prepare reports about
the countries and leaders where they are posted."" The paper asserts that ""it may be interesting to know that
U.S. officials had questions about the mental health of the president of Argentina, but the benefit to citizens of
such a revelation is marginal in proportion to the potential damage to relations between the two countries."" An
op-ed writer for El Universal, claims that the ""released documents show U.S. diplomats rummaging through
personal lives and privately mocking the same leaders whom they publicly treat as friends."" Another daily La
Jornada's in its editorial concludes that ""the main factor of diplomatic tension and greatest security risk to
world peace is not Wikileaks but Washington's belligerent, unilateral and imperialist warmongering, aggravated
now by its defense of opacity.""
Peru
Peru media are focusing on the first alleged cable to come from Peru, on US concern about Iran's interest in
Peru's uranium, as well as regional ""revelations"" in regards neighboring Chile, Venezuela and Argentina. TV,
radio and internet reflect similar slants.
Venezuela
Articles on Interpol's ""Red Notice"" for Julian Assange appeared in most dailies. El Nacional cites assessments
by the Embassy's Economic Counselor about the development of nuclear energy in Venezuela. El Mundo
reports alleged comments by then Ambassador Duddy describing the Venezuelan bank interventions in
November 2009. A columnist in government owned Correo de Orinoco says accuses the U.S. of diplomatic
'excesses,' torture in occupied territories, hiring contractors that fire on crowds, using lies to justify wars in
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Taking a different tack, an Op-Ed in El Universal remarks sarcastically, ""the

I know you are busy but I wanted to close the loop with you on the ED position (Lois Quam), the chair position for
Operations Committee, and the need to ensure that there is specific language in the QDDR that keeps PEPFAR in the
State Department (one or two sentences). I believe it is in all our interests to do this. [AGREE] I also wanted to discuss
with you the process to determine the benchmarks. [I WISH WE COULD GET THEM IN QDDR SO THERE IS FIRMNESS
AND CLARITY— WORRIED IF WE DO IT LATER IT WILL BE A NEGOTIATION AND SQUISHY]; Raj is hesitant to concretize,
plus I know he is very busy. We are going to deliver to him today a version that has been agreed on by CDC and OGAC. I
will propose a process that would include a public vetting of the benchmarks but do not think the benchmarks need to
be specifically defined in the QDDR. [FINE BUT SEE ABOVE — CAN I SEE DRAFT AS IS?] The reference to the Operations
Committee and the Secretary as the trigger for movement into USAID is enough.
I have been made aware of a growing discussion on the Hill around GHI as an attempt by the Administration to diminish
the PEPFAR program contributions because of its association with President Bush. Last night's prime time FOX news
piece (>10 minutes) on PEPFAR was well done. President Bush was clear about why he started PEPFAR and why he feels
it is still the right thing to do and to continue (Humanitarian/Security both addressed). He also spoke directly to the
bipartisan nature of the program (from inception) and the need to continue bipartisan support. It was a missed
opportunity not to have had President Obama on the FOX piece to make the point that ""GNI is building on PEPFAR...""
and to begin a bipartisan dialogue. (WH declined as I understand it) [WE SHOULD MAKE THIS POINT — S ALWAYS CREDITS
BUSH ON THIS B/C HE EARNED IT— WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S PART OF OUR NARRATIVE — I BELIEVE IT CAN BE
DROPPED IN QDDR DRAFT TO THAT EFFECT — CAN YOU WORK WITH DANA TO MAKE SURE THAT LANGUAGE GETS IN BY
SUNDAY?]

Global Fund
I am here through Saturday, then off to Bulgaria to lay in the reform efforts at the Global Fund retreat followed by the
GF Board meeting in Geneva (I won't stay for the whole meeting, just the first day). John Monahan and I have been
aggressive in insisting on Board Chair (BC)and Vice Chair (VC) coordination of the reform effort. This has been reflected
in a letter from BC and VC with ED support that the retreat directly address and coordinate the reform effort, establish a
level for round 10 and address the Maternal and Child Health GF expansion (GWI supports). I feel we will establish
targets and timelines in this meeting with a reporting structure directly to the Board. In addition, there will be
politicking on the election of a new Board Chair (Tedros' term ends in April). It is critical the new chair be fully aligned
with the reform efforts. [GOT IT— FLAGGING FOR S TOO]

American Diplomacy Revealed as Good
By ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed
and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now
condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their
correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give
every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more
conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be
added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow
spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni
leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the
""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions
on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of the
Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and
Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on
embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to
the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,"" ""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,""
""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this
underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""While
we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels
and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'won
big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran
during the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about
Tehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United
States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle
East more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.
The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach
suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinking
about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,"" telling Europeans that
""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have
been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he
expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement that
leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in
Assange's words, would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation
to Iran.
It
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he
also favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's a
loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of
discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the
courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776654 Date: 08/31/2015

We sent the paper on consular fees to Tanner today, and his staff confirmed that he has received it. Assuming Tanner
continues to be supportive, we need him to let Hoyer know he supports our effort.
Additionally, Jack thinks it is important for you to talk to Pelosi. Berman mentioned that as well. I can send a call sheet

Thanks again for stopping by the AIPAC meeting. It really helped close out some important issues.

Subject: excerpt from Julian Assange live online Q and A with the Guardian today
I am a former British diplomat. In the course of my former duties I helped to coordinate multilateral action against a
brutal regime in the Balkans, impose sanctions on a renegade state threatening ethnic cleansing, and negotiate a
debt relief programme for an impoverished nation. None of this would have been possible without the security and
secrecy of diplomatic correspondence, and the protection of that correspondence from publication under the laws of
the UK and many other liberal and democratic states. An embassy which cannot securely offer advice or pass
messages back to London is an embassy which cannot operate. Diplomacy cannot operate without discretion and the
protection of sources. This applies to the UK and the UN as much as the US.
In publishing this massive volume of correspondence, Wikileaks is not highlighting specific cases of wrongdoing but
undermining the entire process of diplomacy. If you can publish US cables then you can publish UK telegrams and UN
emails.
My question to you is: why should we not hold you personally responsible when next an international crisis goes
unresolved because diplomats cannot function.
Julian Assange:
If you trim the vast editorial letter to the singular question actually asked, I would be happy to give it my attention.

Subject: Quartet statement
Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a
call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:
The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the
civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet
reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their

cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct
bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these
negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation
which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.

American Diplomacy Revealed -- as Good
By ROGER COH.E,N
NEW YORK-- Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiteakS dump of a 'quarter-million of their private or secret
cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of the American interest who write
clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-c.hatter about these admirable career diplomats whose
diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose byes have been upturned. Every
journalist knows that if their correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they
would lose most of their sources. That should give every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet,
particularly in the more conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable,

like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but
probably shallow spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United
States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of
venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it
doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the ""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and
nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions on when Iran
will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the
""shock"" of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddati's
taste for voluptuous Slavic women and Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the
biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on embarrassment all these cables
are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to the
familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,""
""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,"" ""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have
become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled,
not least for this underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a
cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""While we don't know nor might not ever know the real
June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was
systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad
'won big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was
evident to anyone in Tehran during_ the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The. .first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as
exercised a.s they are about Tehran in part because they know that any U.','_-;.-Iranian breakthrough
might make them more dispensable to the United States. Their vested interest in the prevailing
Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle East more than
overcoming the U.S.-Iranian Psychosis.
The second is that President .Barack Obarna's approach to Iran has been much more conventional
than his initial outreach suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very
quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinking about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with
""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,""
telling Europeans that ""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added
""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have been overcome; certainly this approach
guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
.Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an
interview with Time, he expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
""coming out with a. very interesting statement that leaders should speak in public like they do in
private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in Assange's words,
would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in
relation to Iran.""
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war
against Iran, an option he also favors. And. that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all
over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a
threat to democracy? He's a loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a
spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic
titillation but no gasp of discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their

publication has done significant damage to the courageous work of America's diplomats and
may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.

Public Opinion in Perspective: Russia

FAVORABLE VIEWS OF U.S. ON THE RISE
Public views of the United States have risen steadily since their low point just after the 2008 Georgia war:
• 47% have a favorable opinion of the United
States, up from 17% in November 2008.
• 71% describe the relationship between
Russia and the United States as ""friendly""
and 79% say it is important for Russia to
maintain good relations with the United
States.
These views are bolstered by favorable views of the
new START agreement and the desire for greater
cooperation between Russia and the United States:
• 66% say it is in Russia's interest to work
closely with the United States and Western
powers.
• 60% think the previous START agreement
benefitted both the United States and Russia equally, and 72% feel that the new START agreement is important.
• A majority would welcome U.S.-Russian cooperation on combating terrorism (87%), stopping the spread of WMDs
(86%), stopping climate change (81%), and halting the flow of drugs through Central Asia (76%).
But Russians are wary of the international mission in Afghanistan and sanctions against Iran:
• 78% oppose their country providing troops to military operations in Afghanistan, and 63% oppose the transit of
international troops through Russian territory or air space. However, pluralities would support taking a larger role in
development assistance (43%) and the transit of aid (45%) to Afghanistan.
• 48% are unaware of Iran's nuclear program. Among those who have heard of the program, 42% see it as a minor
threat to global stability, while 21% see it as no threat at all.
• 45% of those who have heard of the program would support economic sanctions to discourage Iran from continuing
its nuclear program. Only 8% would support military action.
RUSSIANS SEE COMPETITION FOR WORLD LEADERSHIP
Russians feel their country should be a leader on the world stage and appear open to greater integration with the world
economy:
• 87% say it is desirable for Russia to exert leadership in global affairs.
• 63% favor closer economic ties with other countries.
This global outlook is coupled with wariness about the intentions of other countries, and suggests that improved bilateral
cooperation has not erased skepticism about the United States:
• 52% say that the West is trying to impoverish Russia.
• Though increasingly ""friendly"" toward the United States, 58% still see the U.S. more as a competitor than a partner,
and 79% say it is not in Russia's interest for the United States to play a leadership role in global affairs.
RUSSIANS DON'T WANT COOPERATION IN THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
In one arena of international affairs Russian views are especially clear:
• 81% feel that Russia will always have a privileged interest in the CIS countries.
• A majority oppose U.S.-Russian cooperation on resolving the conflicts in South Ossetia (67%), Transnistria (63%),
or Nagorno-Karabakh (60%).

For your reading pleasure on the way home, S/P has been working on a project that I discussed with Jake a while back --
aimed at figuring out where we could do better and above all create more leverage to achieve our goals. The papers are
blunter than anything you would see from the bureaus -- they should not necessarily be read as policy blueprints but
rather as illustrations of alternative strategies. We have made sure that the special assistants have them on the plane. I
will also share the individual papers with the relevant assistant secretaries. We will then be happy to take the project
further if you approve.
You will be happy to know that rain has stopped at the Expo!

Subject: Dear Madam Secretary, Thank you
Madam Secretary:
If you don't know my personal news yet (and I assume that you might through either Huma or Philippe), then here it is: I
Let me say first and foremost: I hope you don't see this as me leaving you or your team. I have asked the question many
times to Philippe and Huma about how you would take this news and the answer has always been the same - that you
would be happy for me - and I truly do hope that this is the case. The truth is that I applied while working in PA/PL and
was eventually wait listed and usually when wait listed you are not given the option to defer. That is neither here nor
there, but Philippe and Huma have both been incredible mentors to me throughout this entire decision-making process,
and for this, I am most grateful to them both.
The decision was not an easy one. First, Madam Secretary, you know when we first met: Believe it or not, it has been
over ten years now, You have not only been a role model and a
mentor for me throughout the years, but I have watched you behind closed doors; out in public; and quite frankly, I have
watched you both win and lose. And whether winning or losing, you are courageous: no matter what, you are
determined and inspirational.
I have seen many people join your team, leave your team, some work for a few years, others for many - and everyone
says they will still be ""part of the family."" Some seem to remain in touch; others don't. I see myself as a little different;
maybe you don't. Both you and President Clinton have watched me grow since I was young. More than anything, I truly
hope to remain a ""part of the family.""
Sometimes people ask me why I have been dedicated to working for you for so many years. It is not for fame or glory.
The truth is, I have worked for you because I have always believed in you. You are one of a kind -
there is no other one like you, and there never will be. I truly believe that the world needs you in whatever capacity that
you are in. And more than anything, I am most appreciative and thankful for all that you have offered me: Not only the
mentorship and guidance but the continuous opportunities to learn. On my own path of public service, I can truly say
that I was able to learn time and time again from the very best.
Parting from your team is thus not an easy task for me, especially leaving Philippe's direct team, where I really enjoy
what I am doing. But I also feel that I want to take another next step forward/a different one in my own life. And I am
hopeful that this is not a permanent goodbye in any way. I hope that you and I can remain in touch via email, and I
promise not to email too often, as I know how busy you are.

But I must reiterate one comment that I made: I have worked for you for so long for a reason: Not for my resume. Not
for myself, But because of you. I am confident enough to say that I know you well enough to tell others that I have
worked for the most brilliant mind and strongest leader I will ever see in my lifetime. And I am incredibly proud of that.
With eternal thanks and appreciation, of which cannot be summed up in words, let alone in an email,
My best, always,

The Secretary had a conversation with Senator Levin today about Jackson/Vanik — Levin told her that the Administration
has been opposed to his efforts to lift the Jackson Vanik restrictions pertaining to Russia. He said that Administration
officials have been telling him that the Russians don't want them lifted. This didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but
she asked me to follow-up with you to find out our current posture on Jackson Vanik and Russia. She'd like to get back
to Senator Levin soon. I leave it up to you how you want to get the info to her, but I did want to pass along her request.
Thanks, and hope all else is well.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed condolences in a rare telephone call with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu December 4 over the deadly fires raging in northern Israel, Israeli officials
said. The two leaders were not believed to have spoken since they last met in September when U.S.-backed peace talks
stalled in a spat over Jewish settlement construction. A statement from Netanyahu's office said Abbas ""expressed his
condolences to the people of Israel on those who died in the fire and said he would be happy to provide any necessary
help.""

Re: UK politics/economy
1. UK polls show support for the Lib-Dems after the launch of the draconian Cameron government budget cratering.
LD support is down to 16 percent, half what it was at its peak during the election and half of LD members now express a
desire to defect from their party. They feel deceived by LD ministers' participation in a Tory budget opposed to their
own beliefs. In Parliament, a secret caucus of LDs is meeting with Labour about opposing the budget. Meanwhile, short
term support for Cameron is static and for the government slightly up, but only translated to the Tories. Both the Tories
and Labour are up, profiting from the LD quandary. The scenario is potentially portentous for the LD Party: There was
once an influential Australian Liberal Democratic Party, holding 11 percent of the vote and the balance of power in the
Australian Senate. Upon reaching its zenith in 1996 the ALDP supported a Liberal (that is to say, a conservative)
government's budget and suffered collapse. Today the ALDP holds 1 percent of the seats in the lower House. The
political effect of the conservative budget will almost certainly lead to an implosion of the Tory-LD coalition. In the short
run it's possible the Tories will emerge having the greatest plurality of support. But if their budget does not produce
prosperity they will pay the price, too. See Stiglitz's analysis below on the Tory budget with cold analysis of the US
predicament.
2. The implications for US-UK cooperation are apparent. While there are spheres that remain, they are contingent,
including the Afghanistan War, opposed by 75 percent of UK public and about which Cameron felt compelled this week
to declare UK engagement would end in five years (that is, before the next UK election). On economic policy, the UK is
no partner and no bridge to Europe, where the Merkel government has entered a fugue state of vertigo (another

subject). At no other time since World War II have the US and UK governments been at such odds over international
economics. With JFK and Macmillan, Macmillan accepted the postwar Keynesian consensus. Reagan and Thatcher, of
course, were of one mind ideologically, and the international economy was buoyed by Reagan's hyper-Keynesianism
masked as Thatcherism. Unfortunately, Obama did not reach out to Brown, who sought to reestablish the special
relationship around international economic recovery. Speaking of laissez faire, Cameron must be let alone to receive the
consequences (within 18 months) of his ideologically driven economics. Can he be engaged on international
development? Or does his budget rule that out too? There's not much there.
3. The Labour Party leadership contest is heating up. David Miliband has an article out today on how the Cameron
budget will foster ""a lost generation."" More on that soon...

Osborne's first Budget? It's wrong, wrong, wrong!
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prizewinner who predicted the global crisis, delivers his verdict on the Chancellor's first Budget
and tells Paul Vallely it will take the UK deeper into recession and hit millions — the poorest — badly Sunday, 27 June 2010
George Osborne will probably not be very bothered that there is a man who thinks he got last week's emergency Budget
almost entirely wrong. But he should be. Because that man is a former chief economist at the World Bank who won the
Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on why markets do not produce the outcomes which, in theory, they ought to.
Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who has been described as the biggest brain in economics, is distinctly unimpressed by George
Osborne's strategy. This, he predicts, will make Britain's recovery from recession longer, slower and harder than it needs
to be. The rise in VAT could even tip us into a double-dip recession.
Stiglitz, who was once Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, is now professor of economics and finance at Columbia
Business School. He was in the UK this week at the University of Manchester, where he chairs the Brooks World Poverty
Institute, but he lifted his head from the detail of international development to scrutinise the economic strategy of the
Conservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat partners recently reversed their judgement that massive public
spending cuts now would endanger the economy and joined in the Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They were deeply
wrong to do so, he believes.
It would be a mistake to ignore Stiglitz on this. He has a track record of getting his predictions right. He was one of the
few economists who predicted the global financial meltdown long before it occurred.
""What happened was very much in accord with what I expected,"" he tells me when we meet for a coffee outside the
Blackwell bookshop in the centre of the university. ""The data was pretty clear about that."" And the scale of the crash?
""That wasn't a surprise,"" he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. ""The bigger the bubble, the bigger the burst.
""The thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-taking activities.
They were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders' money,"" he says. Banks were
demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their innovative financing was adding value. But ""all this
talk about innovation was a sham"" because it did not relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says.
""There was a prima facie case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would lead them to
take excessive risk. But there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were [conducting themselves] at
that level of stupidity. I predicted that there was going to be a collapse because of the information asymmetry problems
that were being created."" His Nobel prize was given for exactly that — showing how markets fail because different people
in them hold different levels of information.
Yet there is no hint of I-told-you-so about Stiglitz's tone as he asks the waiter for coffee. He orders decaffeinated, but
suggests the British economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the ""fiscal consolidation"" which is George
Osborne's economic euphemism for cuts.
Fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. World leaders embarked on that strategy — injecting money to re-energise the
economy — after the banking crash three years ago. It was widely perceived not to have worked because the money
governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses or individuals in trouble with their
mortgages.
""The problem was that, in the US, the stimulus wasn't big enough,"" he says. ""Too much of it was in tax cuts. And when
they gave money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has not been restored — we can
expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than last year — and the economy has not been

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
restarted."" Instead of producing a consensus that the government should have done more, it has created disillusion that
the government can do anything, Stiglitz says.
The result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on Greece and then Spain, everybody is now in a mood
of retrenchment. ""It's not just pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite,"" he says. By which he means governments are not just
refusing to stimulate, they are making cuts, as Herbert Hoover did in the US in 1929 — when he turned the Wall Street
Crash into the Great Depression. ""Hoover had this idea that, whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he
decided to go for cuts — which is what the foolish financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now
want.""
It has become the new received wisdom throughout Europe. But it is the classic error made by those who confuse a
household's economics with those of a national economy.
""If you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to pay the debts.
But in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the
amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up — and you don't have
enough money to pay your debts.
""The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of experiments which show
this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF,"" he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. ""So we know what will happen:
economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know
— it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT
and went into another recession.""
Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by ideology; the
national deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market
only cares about one thing — getting repaid. And because other European governments are panicking because of the
market's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want to be next.
""But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will suffer. The cuts will all feed back negatively.
And if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more cuts and raise
taxes more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a
double dip if everybody cuts back at the same time. The best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. If
any one of these countries is forced into default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real
problems. This is really risky, really scary.""
So what should we be doing? ""The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. You cut out the war
in Afghanistan. You cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. You cut out oil subsidies.
There's a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending in other areas, such as research and development,
infrastructure, education"" — areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money. ""I
haven't done the calculation for Britain, but, for the US, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per
cent and the long-term deficit debt is lowered.""
Taxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to 28 per cent.
""There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per cent.
There's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people have speculated or not. But you lower the tax
on investment in things like R&D.""
Stiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. Governments should set up their own banks to restart lending to
businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. ""If the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending
facility to do that job,"" he says. ""In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we had used a fraction of that to create a
new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was needed.""
Indeed, it could be done for far less. ""Take $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the private sector] and
that's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity — more than the real economy needs.""
Such a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair. Stiglitz is sceptical,
too, about the moral underpinning of a Budget which claims that ""we are all in this together"", but then hits the poorest
hardest.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's Budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of
their income, while the rich will lose just 1 per cent. ""I've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in
public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor,"" Stiglitz says. Osborne's Budget ""may be well-
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
intentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that
magnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately"".
His big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a second.
""Developing countries have redirected themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in recent years, so growth in
Africa will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of the downturn,"" he says.
Even so, aid remains vital to poor countries. ""If aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected,"" he says. ""China is
providing aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in education and health -
areas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts.""
Joseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now — developing and developed — is not retrenchment but
greater economic stimulus. It is not a message many are in the mood to hear. But they didn't listen to him last time,
either. And he turned out to be right, and they were wrong — and at what a cost to us all.

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

American Diplomacy Revealed — as Good
By ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their
private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of
the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable
career diplomats whose diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they
whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their
correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most
of their sources. That should give every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will
self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more conspiratorial parts
of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East.

Layers of secrecy will be added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S.
interests across a broad but probably shallow spectrum. That will satisfy him in
that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond
the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking for war on the cheap
against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or
the ""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the
""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions on when Iran will have a
nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the
""shock"" of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar
el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and Silvio Beriusconi's taste for
all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and
short on embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with
the world as we already knew it, right down to the familiar adjectives evoking
French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,"" ""authoritarian,""
""erratic,"" ""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department
people could have become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats

Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai:
""While we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is
clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was systematic
vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that
Ahmadinejad 'won big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American
diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran during the election and its
violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of
the Gulf are as exercised as they are about Tehran in part because they know
that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the
United States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic
equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle East more than overcoming
the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.
The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much
more conventional than his initial outreach suggested_ Old habits of attempted
coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired
thinking about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling
Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was
talking ""dual track,"" telling Europeans that ""engagement alone is unlikely to

succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could
never have been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding
Iranian grievances would fester.
Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or
diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he expressed approval for Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement that
leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and
bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in Assange's words, would ""lead to some
kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in
relation to Iran.""
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls
for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he also favors. And that, for
Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns
that America is a threat to democracy? He's a loose canon; let him be. My
impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering
plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of discovery. They provide texture
but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage
to the courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a
tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.

Sarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion and
politics
By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend
Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM
Sarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.
In her new book, ""America by Heart,"" Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial
Association, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by
his views rather than his faith. ""Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,""
Kennedy said. ""I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.""
Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy's speech had ""succeeded in the best possible
way: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either."" Now, however, she says she has revisited the
speech and changed her mind. She finds it ""defensive . . . in tone and content"" and is upset that Kennedy, rather than
presenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an ""unequivocal divorce of the two.""
Palin's argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no
religious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a
test. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would
not.
If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate's religious affiliation to be ""reconciled."" My uncle urged
that religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would
lead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and
demean their opponents.
Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance
of a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and
peace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church
they belonged to.
But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy for not ""telling the
country how his faith had enriched him."" With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path
my uncle warned against when he said that a president's religious views should be ""neither imposed by him upon the
nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.""
After all, a candidate's faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.
Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?
Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, ""rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services
and education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools."" She
does not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in
parochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he
wisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax
money should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.
As a contrast to Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks during the 2008
Republican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of ""how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were
elected."" After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies ""intent on
establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.""
""There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,"" Romney said. ""What do I believe about Jesus Christ?""
Romney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that ""Jesus Christ is the son of God.""
Palin praises Romney for delivering a ""thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in
American public life."" But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to
respond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?
When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect
for the Constitution and the founders' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions
should not play a role in political campaigns.
Palin contends that Kennedy sought to ""run away from religion."" The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made
America so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that
faith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those
whose religious beliefs differed from their own.
To demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the
precise reason that America is exceptional.
Palin's book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their
beliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don't match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for ""talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.""
Who is Palin to say what God's ""walk"" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?
This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, ""But let
us judge not that we not be judged."" The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,
contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others' souls and assess their worthiness.
Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in
fealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever
interfered with his duty as president.
My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister
died in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT
boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.
America's first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-:
.:1,rai.adc'res and invoked the Bible's
command to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We are
confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.""
Faith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles' and my father's dedication to justice. My father,
Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled ""Suppose God Is -
Black."" And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he
took positions ""directly at odds with his Catholic faith.""
Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at
times. But as we have seen, the hierarchy's positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring
about those changes. That may not be Palin's theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would
disagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.
John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness
and contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech.
Palin, for her part, argues that ""morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs."" That statement
amounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would
support such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction
that Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show ""malice toward none, with charity for ail.""
Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth
precisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,
corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.
Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn't read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesn't know it by heart. Or
she may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don't know.
I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-
won ideal of religious freedom that is among our country's greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in Houston,
that is the ""kind of America I believe in.""

he wants to come see you about Frank's last trip.

WikiLeaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how he
inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets <http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-28/wikileaks-
documents-chinas-google-hack-un-spying-more-secrets/> to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and
wicked—but their revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized
the press, you clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to
solve the most dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S.
policymakers and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical
information from foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of
pressure to apply on allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping
common action with cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did
he toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention,
and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial.
Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not
by the hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a

hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some
time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant
went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world
problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve
crucial world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds
and lies. His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders
are really doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see
what was plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to
the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the
cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president
is a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
—
No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need
for serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

From today's roundtable on Afghanistan with Amb. Khalilzad, George Will, and Zbigniew Brzezinski:
ZB: ... We haven't had a better alternative than Karzai, and yet some of our officials have
made a sport of maligning him. This business of corruption doesn't take into account
cultural differences. And last but not least, who are we here in Washington to be moaning
and groaning about corruption?
CA: Let me ask you then, should Ambassador Eikenberry leave? I mean, has he done a good job,
do you think, for the diplomacy, George?
GW: Well he has a hopeless job to do, so it's hard to say whether he's done it well. If he
should leave because of what was said in the -
CA: What he has written in the cables?
GW: Well, who's going to be left in the government, starting with the Secretary of State?
ZK: I think he has been damaged very badly by the leaks that have taken place here in
Washington, before WikiLeaks and afterwards. And a trusting relationship, if that is the
objective, and I believe it ought to be, would require I think changes to the personnel that
are responsible on a day-to-day basis in dealing with President Karzai.
... [exchange about corruption and about Iran]
CA: Do you think, I asked George, Ambassador Eikenberry is doing a good job and should he
stay in his position?
ZK: Well I think he's doing a good job, but I think he's no longer an effective interlocutor
due to the leaks.
CA: Which means?
ZK: Which means that if we want to deal with the issue of partnership with the government of
Afghanistan, if we want to deal with the issue of domestic politics effectively, catalyzing
cooperation, we would need to have a new team to be able to do that.

The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.

Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

Dear Melanne
******************
The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus""affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.
""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.
Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

U.S. diplomats to ""cease and desist telling the truth until further notice.""
""We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

I tried to get them to switch the agenda to include Egypt instead of China — they are determined to raise China but we
agreed that it will come last — so right now there will be a quick mention of Egypt at the top by Elisa Massimino from
Human Rights First (who will open the meeting and serve as traffic cop). Then Karen Ryan from the Carter Center will
raise DRC, followed by Ken Roth of Human Rights Watch who will raise Af/Pak issues, then David Kramer (former A/S in
DRL now at Freedom House) raising China issues. The goal is to allow 15 minutes at the end for S (along with Dan Friend
and Harold ) to raise Gitmo issues and ask for their support. We now have 45 minutes for the meeting

Melanne,
I got through to my Norwegian counterpart here and she told me that the Norwegian
Foreign Ministry is working on the text of a statement that Oslo hopes to issue today. She was very worried that Norway
had somehow end up catalyzing unjustified attacks on and thought it important that Oslo set the record 1.4(D)
straight. She believed the statement would be short and concise. She encouraged us to raise the issue also in Oslo. The B1
phone connection was a little shaky, but I think she mentioned that her Minister would be in Washington over the next
couple of days.

It was far too late to call when I was freed up.

New Start: Ratify, With Caveats
The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, but senators should make it clear to
Moscow that they don't see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses.
By CONDOLEEZZA RICE
When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear
threat by reducing offensive weapons,-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the
wake of America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States
and Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.
Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment
of a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real
threat was that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world's most dangerous
regimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states also
pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United States
and our allies.
It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.
The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence.
While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a
triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfully
reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last
year.
Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and its
reinstatement is crucial.
Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if the
treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administration's commitments.
First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has
led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of
Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully
fund the president's program.
Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense
strategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen
Hadley.
Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold War
link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the
""interrelationship"" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will not
limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.
Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remain
fully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing both
potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.
I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians
need to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to
intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.
Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our
missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently
between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.
After all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly.
Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in the
Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russia's unstable south—are dangerous.
That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from
tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russia
knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is not in its
interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran and its
longstanding concern about Pyongyang.
The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for a
long time.
After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. and
Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to each other or to international stability.
A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear
security (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New
Start treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record of
ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether in the lame-duck session or next year.

******************
The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a

sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.
""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.

Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

VIOLENCE IN HAITI AS MANIGAT, CELESTIN ADVANCE TO RUNOFF
(SBU) Announced results conflicted with the EU-backed National Observation Council's preliminary reports
that Michel Martelly led government-backed candidate Jude Celestin in the vote, media report. Embassy Port-
au-Prince reports civil society representatives took care in announcing early findings, but the information was
reported locally as hard fact. Post notes gunfire could be heard throughout Port-au-Prince after results were
announced late December 7.

MBEKI MEETS WITH SUDANESE LEADERS TO DISCUSS ABYEI
(SBU) Thabo Mbeki, head of the African Union Panel on Sudan, described the meeting with President Bashir
and First Vice President Kiir as positive, according to press. The Office of the Special Envoy for Sudan comments
the meeting was held to discuss an African Union paper outlining options for resolving the Abyei issue. Bashir
and Kiir committed to meet one-on-one to develop a solution and said they would keep Mbeki informed as their
discussions progress.

As Haiti enters the period of electoral contestation, it is essential that all political actors remain
calm and encourage their supporters to do the same. The United States, together with Haiti's
international community partners, stands ready to support efforts to thoroughly review irregularities
in support of electoral results that are consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in
their votes.
Like others, the Government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral
Council's announcement of results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent
with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more
than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide, election-day
observations by official U.S. observers accredited by the CEP, and vote counts observed around the
country by numerous domestic and international observers.
Haiti's transition to democracy over the past 24 years has seen many successes, overcoming major
challenges. The 2010 elections represent a critical test of whether the Haitian people will
determine their destiny through their vote. The United States is committed to the consolidation of
democracy in Haiti and calls on the Government of Haiti, the CEP and all political forces to ensure
that the will of the people is fully reflected in the outcome of this election.

Afghan TV police drama delivers message with zest
Partially funded by the U.S. and aided by Australian TV veterans, the series 'Eagle Four'
follows an elite Afghan police squad. It has a political agenda but gets points for being
entertaining.
By Laura King, Los Angeles Times
6:20 PM PST, December 7, 2010
Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan

A suicide bomber is loose in the city, and the clock is ticking. But an elite squad of Afghan cops is on the case,
working street sources and mining databases, equally at ease with witty one-liners and fully loaded assault
rifles, looking cool and soulful all the while.
In real life, the Afghan police are better known for illiteracy, drug abuse and shaking down citizens than for
daring exploits worthy of the big screen—or the small one. But on the popular new TV series ""Eagle Four,""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777826 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777826 Date: 08/31/2015
the squad's resourcefulness, heroism and teamwork never fail to carry the day.
The show, which has slick production values and a noir-ish soundtrack, is midway through its initial run of 13
episodes, and has already garnered a large, loyal following on Tolo TV, the country's most-watched station.
With the show shot entirely in Kabul, the Afghan capital, open-air takes were sometimes ruined by eager
onlookers — from ragged street urchins to cellphone-toting businessmen — trying to get close to the cast and
crew.
But overly enthusiastic fans were a happy diversion from challenges such as placating an angry mullah who
tried to raise a mob to halt the production or dealing with Taliban death threats against several cast members.
""We didn't know at first what the response was going to be,"" said Faramjan Abrahim, who plays the cocky,
hotheaded rookie Baktash. ""But then actual policemen started to come up and call me 'brother' and congratulate
me for doing a good job solving the case.""
Most viewers are probably unaware that the series is financed at least in part by the public diplomacy arm of the
U.S. Embassy, which acknowledged its monetary support while declining to disclose a dollar amount. A team
of Australian TV veterans was brought in to mentor the Afghans working on the show.
Boosting public respect for the Afghan security forces and drawing higher-quality recruits are crucial to U.S.
hopes that the police and army will be ready to assume responsibility for the country's security in three years —
a goal some consider way too optimistic.
""We see this as an opportunity not only to help support the Afghan media sector, but hopefully also encourage a
dialogue among Afghans about the role of police in society, and their growing capabilities,"" said embassy
spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Another U.S.-funded effort is planned for next year: a reality show that will seek
to impart a frisson of glamour to joining the Afghan army.
If it's entertainment with a political agenda, ""Eagle Four"" gets points for being, well, entertaining. It's got all the
requisite cop-show elements: rapid-fire action; a gritty, cinema verite feel; and engrossing interplay among the
four squad members and their hard-edged but beloved leader, Chief Amin (who is tormented by a dark secret;
more on that later).
The show's Afghan and Australian creators said ""Eagle Four"" was inspired by the hit U.S. drama ""24."" The
mood and pacing are similar, but the resemblance doesn't extend to American Jack Bauer's propensity for
torturing suspects until they crack.
Baktash occasionally gets carried away and roughs someone up, but he is reprimanded by his older, more-
seasoned partner, Kamran, who shows him that finesse works better than brute force.
""My character is basically a good guy, but he's sort of undisciplined, and he has a lot to learn,"" Abrahim said. A
recurring theme is that when Baktash disregards Kamran's counsel, he usually gets injured within the next few
scenes. ""He disobeys, he gets hurt,"" Abrahim said, laughing.
The show's producers take plenty of dramatic license, including the presence of two women on the four-member
team, a mingling of the sexes unlikely to be found in any police squad room in this tradition-bound, male-
dominated Islamic society. The show's makers see gender equality as an ideal worth reinforcing, even if there's
little real-life evidence of it in Afghanistan.
Finding actresses to play the female leads was extremely difficult. Men outnumbered women more than 10 to 1
at auditions. One actress dropped out of the production because of family pressure; writers had to kill off her

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777826 Date: 08/31/2015
character. At one point, executive producer Trudi-Ann Tierney, one of the Australians brought in to bolster
Afghan-owned production company Kaboora, stepped in and donned a burka to play a suspect's silent wife and
a woman's bloodied corpse.
The female characters mainly stay in the office, mirroring the reality that Afghan women are relatively little
seen in public. But one of them, Ludmilla, is a computer whiz who relentlessly chases suspects through
cyberspace. The script calls for periodic crisp pronouncements from her such as ""I've got a fix on the location""
or ""Looks like the bomber is a decoy.""
Somewhat daringly, there's even a love story, albeit a chaste one, between Ludmilla, who manages to make her
black head scarf and loose-fitting clothing look Hollywood sultry, and the impetuous Baktash. The two of them
bicker their way through much of the season, in classic romantic-comedy tradition.
She eventually softens toward him after he shows sensitivity and understanding about her feelings of guilt over
having inadvertently contributed to someone's death. In the final episode of the season — spoiler alert! — they
make plans for him to meet her father.
""The whole time, they don't even lock eyes,"" Tierney said. ""But everyone can see they have feelings for each
other.""
Even if the show's popularity doesn't translate into heightened respect for the Afghan police, the principals
believe it does justice to many aspects of Afghan life. One plot line has the seemingly incorruptible Chief Amin
submitting to blackmail and deliberately compromising a case after his son is kidnapped.
""It's all part of our social reality: drug-smuggling, suicide bombs, insurgents, graft, abductions,"" director Ghafar
Azad said. ""That's all in the show. So in a lot of ways, it's telling the truth.""

would be to include members of congress and frame the event as the QDDR making the case for State/USAID's mission
and resources in the new environment. We could take the event in a number of directions (Liz would LOVE to get Gates
together with Clinton) but the idea to launch the QDDR in January with USGLC as the blueprint for supporting
international affairs and the 150 account.
Thoughts? -D

******************
The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus""affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.
""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.
Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, as
Walter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of ""those idiot boards""—the TelePrompters on which the great
orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a
Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the
Obamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a
few hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.
In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were
hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but at
the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems
quite extensive for these troubled times.)
Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-
esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some
of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,
and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in
governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that
he offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.
Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the
first two years—""I can handle them,"" Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the
White House's new determination to ""reach out."" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they
would ""reach out,"" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is that
someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be
""comfortable.""
For example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all
accounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon's
being given his new position was that ""the President is comfortable with him."" Just as Obama is described as pleased with
himself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,
and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those
who had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there
were no ""grown-ups"" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.
When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as ""not one of ours."" Joe
Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White
House....
Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The
fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at ""messaging"" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had
no overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide
about this, he pointed to what had been billed as a ""major speech on the economy,"" at Georgetown University in April
2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both
Obama and his top staff. An ally says, ""You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where
you're going."" Another says, ""They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.""
Thus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over
the place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that we
shouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was making
economic, progress.
So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his
swearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who
were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,
so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was
doing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010
campaign....
More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to
defend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:
""Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got the
advertising properly about what was going on."" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was
generally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, ""Bullocks! What policies?"")
The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care
(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic
press conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't
really understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, ""Their definition of
governing is passing bills."" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so
criticized for being ""arrogant"" and ""aloof,"" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (""And I take responsibility for that,""
Obama said again and again.)","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777937 Date: 08/31/2015

Afghan TV police drama delivers message with zest
Partially funded by the U.S. and aided by Australian TV veterans, the series 'Eagle Four' follows an elite Afghan police
squad. It has a political agenda but gets points for being entertaining.
By Laura King, Los Angeles Times
6:20 PM PST, December 7, 2010
Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan
Advertisement
A suicide bomber is loose in the city, and the clock is ticking. But an elite squad of Afghan cops is on the case, working
street sources and mining databases, equally at ease with witty one-liners and fully loaded assault rifles, looking cool
and soulful all the while.
In real life, the Afghan police are better known for illiteracy, drug abuse and shaking down citizens than for daring
exploits worthy of the big screen — or the small one. But on the popular new TV series ""Eagle Four,"" the squad's
resourcefulness, heroism and teamwork never fail to carry the day.
The show, which has slick production values and a noir-ish soundtrack, is midway through its initial run of 13 episodes,
and has already garnered a large, loyal following on Tolo TV, the country's most-watched station.
With the show shot entirely in Kabul, the Afghan capital, open-air takes were sometimes ruined by eager onlookers —
from ragged street urchins to cellphone-toting businessmen — trying to get close to the cast and crew.
But overly enthusiastic fans were a happy diversion from challenges such as placating an angry mullah who tried to raise
a mob to halt the production or dealing with Taliban death threats against several cast members.
""We didn't know at first what the response was going to be,"" said Faramjan Abrahim, who plays the cocky, hotheaded
rookie Baktash. ""But then actual policemen started to come up and call me 'brother' and congratulate me for doing a
good job solving the case.""
Most viewers are probably unaware that the series is financed at least in part by the public diplomacy arm of the U.S.
Embassy, which acknowledged its monetary support while declining to disclose a dollar amount. A team of Australian TV
veterans was brought in to mentor the Afghans working on the show.
Boosting public respect for the Afghan security forces and drawing higher-quality recruits are crucial to U.S. hopes that
the police and army will be ready to assume responsibility for the country's security in three years — a goal some
consider way too optimistic.

""We see this as an opportunity not only to help support the Afghan media sector, but hopefully also encourage a
dialogue among Afghans about the role of police in society, and their growing capabilities,"" said embassy spokeswoman
Caitlin Hayden. Another U.S.-funded effort is planned for next year: a reality show that will seek to impart a frisson of
glamour to joining the Afghan army.
If it's entertainment with a political agenda, ""Eagle Four"" gets points for being, well, entertaining. It's got all the requisite
cop-show elements: rapid-fire action; a gritty, cinema verite feel; and engrossing interplay among the four squad
members and their hard-edged but beloved leader, Chief Amin (who is tormented by a dark secret; more on that later).
The show's Afghan and Australian creators said ""Eagle Four"" was inspired by the hit U.S. drama ""24."" The mood and
pacing are similar, but the resemblance doesn't extend to American Jack Bauer's propensity for torturing suspects until
they crack.
Baktash occasionally gets carried away and roughs someone up, but he is reprimanded by his older, more-seasoned
partner, Kamran, who shows him that finesse works better than brute force.
""My character is basically a good guy, but he's sort of undisciplined, and he has a lot to learn,"" Abrahim said. A recurring
theme is that when Baktash disregards Kamran's counsel, he usually gets injured within the next few scenes. ""He
disobeys, he gets hurt,"" Abrahim said, laughing.
The show's producers take plenty of dramatic license, including the presence of two women on the four-member team,
a mingling of the sexes unlikely to be found in any police squad room in this tradition-bound, male-dominated Islamic
society. The show's makers see gender equality as an ideal worth reinforcing, even if there's little real-life evidence of it
in Afghanistan.
Finding actresses to play the female leads was extremely difficult. Men outnumbered women more than 10 to 1 at
auditions. One actress dropped out of the production because of family pressure; writers had to kill off her character. At
one point, executive producer Trudi-Ann Tierney, one of the Australians brought in to bolster Afghan-owned production
company Kaboora, stepped in and donned a burka to play a suspect's silent wife and a woman's bloodied corpse.
The female characters mainly stay in the office, mirroring the reality that Afghan women are relatively little seen in
public. But one of them, Ludmilla, is a computer whiz who relentlessly chases suspects through cyberspace. The script
calls for periodic crisp pronouncements from her such as ""I've got a fix on the location"" or ""Looks like the bomber is a
decoy.""
Somewhat daringly, there's even a love story, albeit a chaste one, between Ludmilla, who manages to make her black
head scarf and loose-fitting clothing look Hollywood sultry, and the impetuous Baktash. The two of them bicker their
way through much of the season, in classic romantic-comedy tradition.
She eventually softens toward him after he shows sensitivity and understanding about her feelings of guilt over having
inadvertently contributed to someone's death. In the final episode of the season — spoiler alert! — they make plans for
him to meet her father.
""The whole time, they don't even lock eyes,"" Tierney said. ""But everyone can see they have feelings for each other.""
Even if the show's popularity doesn't translate into heightened respect for the Afghan police, the principals believe it
does justice to many aspects of Afghan life. One plot line has the seemingly incorruptible Chief Amin submitting to
blackmail and deliberately compromising a case after his son is kidnapped.
""It's all part of our social reality: drug-smuggling, suicide bombs, insurgents, graft, abductions,"" director Ghafar Azad
said. ""That's all in the show. So in a lot of ways, it's telling the truth.""

During his November visit, US President Barack Obama said the United States and Indonesia ""are forging an even
stronger relationship and deepening partnerships."" A new, high-tech cultural center is the latest example of the growing
partnership between the countries.
Last week, the US Embassy officially opened @America, its first cultural center in Jakarta. The center is located on the
third floor of the Pacific Place Mall in Central Jakarta.
The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Dec. 2 was attended by Alfitra Salam, the Indonesian deputy minister for youth
empowerment, and the US under secretary for public diplomacy, Judith McHale.
Equipped with what has been called Jakarta's fastest Wi-Fi, all the high-tech features in @America are available to use for
free.
McHale said she hoped the facility would make it easier for Indonesians and Americans to communicate.
Adrian Arie, head of the center, said they were working with large American technology companies like Google, Microsoft
and Cisco.
For example, Microsoft contributed several of its newly released Kinect motion gaming devices for the opening celebration
on Wednesday night.
And Cisco's TelePresence technology has been incorporated into the center to facilitate video conferencing.
Entering the state-of the-art facility, valued at some $2 million, is quite an experience.
From the outside, visitors can see three big screens displaying videos related to the cultural center's bi-monthly theme.
On opening night the screens were displaying images from the Sant Ocean Hall of the Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History to go with the center's first theme, Ocean and Marine Environments.
The changing themes will be the unifying concept behind all of the activities the center puts on during those two months.

After passing through a security scan, lockers made of transparent glass are provided for guests to store their bags. You
are only allowed to bring handheld items into the center.
Once inside, you will see screens wherever you go.
Turn right, and you will immediately see Google's Liquid Galaxy.
Equipped with seven wide-screen Ns, Liquid Galaxy is used to display Google Earth. You can view and manipulate
maps of the earth, the moon and Mars in spectacular high-definition.
There is a touch-screen keyboard that lets you pick popular locations and a joystick to zoom in and rotate the images.
A few cities, such as New York, are already available in 3-D, which means you can virtually walk along Fifth Avenue in
Manhattan and look around in every direction.
There are other features at the center that are definitely worth checking out.
There are touch-screen computers in the corner where visitors can play games or get quizzed on their knowledge of
America.
A digital photo booth is available next to the information center and there is a small auditorium that can fit about 200
people.
During presentations or panel discussions, real-time video of the event will be displayed around the venue and on the
center's Web site, atamerica.or.id.
For gadget lovers, there are also 16 iPads available for use inside the center.
And for those who have never had the chance to use an iPad before, the staff will happily provide a quick tutorial.
Even though it has only been open for about a week, @America has already hosted two presentations.
Last weekend it had a presentation on the discoveries of the Okeanos Explorer, a marine research vessel, and a two-day
event, held in conjunction with EducationUSA, to provide students with information about studying in the United States.
The center has also invited a group of prominent bloggers for a discussion about social media. Adrian said the center was
planning movie screenings and music shows in upcoming weeks.
He welcomed program ideas, which can be submitted through the center's Web site.
@America is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, and will be open throughout the holiday season.

Senator DeMint is insisting that he and Sujay sit down to personally review her post-hearing QFR answers. This is highly
unusual. We offered Sujay up right away, but DeMint's staff insisted that the Senator was only available to meet on
December 16 (the Senate target adjournment date is December 17). This effectively scuttles any chance Sujay has of
getting confirmed this Congress.
Unfortunately, we don't have much recourse. Sujay's nomination will remain on Tuesday's business meeting agenda, but
given his request, DeMint will exercise his prerogative and ask that she be held over. With no other business meetings
scheduled this year, she'll remain stuck in Committee.
There's another factor at play here too. We learned yesterday afternoon that Sujay has taken it upon herself to reach out
to different Senator's offices. I don't know what exactly she's been saying, but the leg officer (a State Department fellow)
handling Sujay's nomination got an email from Hatch's office. He has been supportive of her and we have a good working
relationship with them. I don't know what Sujay said, but the message back from Hatch's person is that ""while we do
support her, this really makes us question her common sense and judgment."" We obviously told her to stop her outreach
campaign.
Finally, Hatch's office also informed us that Brownback is rumored to be considering a hold on Sujay's nomination if
DeMint for any reason relents.

Of Funds To Haiti's Central Government
And Of Travel Visas For The Government's Leaders
Who Are 'Trying To Subvert The Will Of The People'
[(FRIDAY, Dec. 10) -- US. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Friday said he has urged the Obama Administration
to withhold funding to the central government of Haiti, and to suspend visas for travel to the United States by
senior Haitian Government officials and their immediate family members, until necessary steps are taken to
ensure a fair and democratic outcome to the elections held on November 28, 2010. Leahy chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee 's Subcommittee on The State Department and Foreign Operations, which handles
the Senate 's work in funding foreign assistance, including aid to Haiti, and the State Department's
budget. Leahy also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles immigration policy issues. Leahy
released the following statement.]
""As if Haiti did not have enough problems, now, once again, those in power there are trying to
subvert the will of the people. The United States must come down squarely in support of the
Haitian people's right to choose their leaders freely and fairly. By suspending direct aid to the
central government and visas for top officials and their immediate family members, the United
States would be sending that message. This process needs to bring about a legitimate
government respected by the Haitian people and recognized by the international community.""

Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at

Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.
These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation
pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;
create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a
framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.
The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United
States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue
building on this progress.

Any chance the Secretary could call Leahy to thank him this evening? The State Dept spokesman's reaction to Leahy's
statement didn't help.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778257 Date: 08/31/2015
[(FRIDAY, Dec. 10) -- U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Friday said he has urged the Obama Administration to withhold
funding to the central government of Haiti, and to suspend visas for travel to the United States by senior Haitian
Government officials and their immediate family members, until necessary steps are taken to ensure a fair and
democratic outcome to the elections held on November 28, 2010. Leahy chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee's
Subcommittee on The State Department and Foreign Operations, which handles the Senate's work in funding foreign
assistance, including aid to Haiti, and the State Department's budget. Leahy also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee,
which handles immigration policy issues. Leahy released the following statement]
""As if Haiti did not have enough problems, now, once again, those in power there are trying to subvert the will of the
people. The United States must come down squarely in support of the Haitian people's right to choose their leaders
freely and fairly. By suspending direct aid to the central government and visas for top officials and their immediate
family members, the United States would be sending that message. This process needs to bring about a legitimate
government respected by the Haitian people and recognized by the international community.""

Washington (CNN) -- The United States may have to expand its role from Middle East peace talks facilitator to become a
broker on specific core issues, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said on December 12. Appearing on the ABC
program ""This Week,"" Fayyad indicated that progress toward a peace settlement could occur in the short-term despite
Israel's refusal to halt construction of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. However, Israel must
provide specifics about its position on core issues such as what a Palestinian state would entail, the status of Jerusalem
and the return of refugees, Fayyad said, adding that the lack of a new settlement freeze erodes trust in the process.
Asked if the United States would need to offer so-called ""bridging"" proposals on specific issues to try to stimulate
negotiations, Fayyad said that ""may be necessary."" ""It may be unavoidable, actually, for the United States, acting as a
broker at some point, to come in with bridging proposals so we make this happen,"" he said. The interview, which
included Israeli opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, took place two days after U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton outlined a direction for the peace process after giving up on trying to persuade Israel to again freeze
settlement construction as a condition for the direct talks to resume.

Israeli-Palestinian negotiations must be grounded in international law
and human rights — define borders and address security issues first.
13 December 2010
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For nearly two decades, there have been peace processes in the Middle East but no peace.
In our recent visits to four countries across the region and the occupied Palestinian territory,
we heard a consistent message: people want peace, but are skeptical about the process and
have little faith in the international community to deliver.
There is now an opportunity to reassess the entire approach to the negotiations. The flawed
U.S. effort to secure from Israel another partial freeze on settlement-building, in exchange for
generous inducements, as a way of resuming direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian
leaders has failed.
We now urge a renewed effort, firmly based on international law and respect for human
rights, aimed at defining boundaries between Israel and a new Palestinian state and ad-
dressing security issues, without neglecting the other issues at the core of the conflict. With-
out such focus, we may see the possibility of a two-state solution slipping even further away.
Our primary purpose is to help bring peace and security to Israel and its neighbors.
We therefore call on governments and citizens around the world to insist that future
negotiations are based on the following:
1. Universal human rights and respect for international humanitarian law must apply
equally to all.
2. The occupation must end, and the aim of negotiations should be to define the
boundaries of a future Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, including its capital
in East Jerusalem. Such an accord could entail, if agreed, a one-to-one land swap to
allow for minor adjustments. Initial negotiations should also aim at security arrange-
ments in which both Israelis and Palestinians have confidence.
3. The remaining final status issues can be addressed more effectively once there is an
agreement on borders and security.
4. Israeli settlements are illegal and all settlement activity must halt throughout the oc-
cupied Palestinian territory including in East Jerusalem.
5. Israel must lift its illegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza and stop the demolition and
seizure of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
6. Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza must end all human rights viola-
tions against political critics and rivals.
7. Israel's right to exist must not be denied. Incitement and calls for the destruction of

Twas the Night Before the QDDR
December 13, 2010
By Connie Veillette in Rethinking U.S. Foreign Assistance Tags: QDDR
Twas two weeks before Christmas, when all through the town
Breaths were held expectantly, in the midst of a countdown.
With their keyboards ready, the bloggers abandoned all care,
Hoping that Secretary Clinton soon would be there.
The NGOs were nestled all snug in their beds,
Knowing the QDDR soon would be read.
And the Senate and House, with a sharp rap,
Had just left town for a long winter's nap.
When out on the Mall there arose such a clatter,
Aid analysts sprang from their cubicles to see what was the matter.
Away to their lnboxes they flew like a flash,
Tore open their emails and emptied the cache.
The moon on the breast of the soon-to-fall snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to the stalled traffic below.
When, what to their wondering eyes should appear,
But an armored car, and eight men in full gear.

With a diplomatic wit, married to Bill,
They knew in a moment it must be St Hill.
More rapid than eagles her people, they came,
And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!
""Now Slaughter! Now, Radelet! Now, Geithner and Shah!
On, Nides! On, Steinberg! On Yohannes, hurrah!
To the top of the White House! To the top of the Hill!
Now dash away! Dash away! Get us good will!""
And then, in a flash, her people took to the phone
Spreading the word about what few had known.
As the developmentistas gathered to find common ground,
Behind the podium St Hillary came with a bound.
Her eyes-how they twinkled! Her hair how flaxen!
Her cheeks were like roses, the cameras were flashin'!
Her smart red suit was adorned with a bow,
The perfect ""development diplomat"" from head to toe.
She addressed the crowd on integration and elevation,
And gave USAID some special designation!
A wink of her eye and a twist of her head,
Soon let them dream that they had fewer things to dread.
She spoke many words, and expressed her complete vision,
While her colleagues set about implementing the QDDR's decision.
And laying her finger aside of her nose,
And giving a nod, she departed, nothing else to disclose!
She sprang to her car, to her team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But they heard her exclaim, 'ere she drove out of sight,
""Just trust me on this, it will all be alright!""
May all your dreams come true, from your friends at the Rethinking U.S. Foreign Assistance initiative — Connie,
Sarah Jane, and Casey — and with many thanks for the creative talents of Casey Dunning and Julie Walz.

Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and

Secretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Passing of Richard Holbrooke
Tonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke
served the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and
high-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind --
a true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778383 Date: 08/31/2015
From his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.
He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values
even under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,
helping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark
on the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,
people have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.
I had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As
Secretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the
State Department and for the United States of America.
True to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his
friends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to
everyone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.
Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-
children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and
colleagues.

According to the Reid staff, they will tentatively start the Treaty on Wednesday and stay on it through COB Thursday.
Then File cloture on the CR. It takes consent to stay on START while we wait for the CR cloture petition to ripen, which
would be Saturday w/o consent. So at least two days on the Treaty, at a minimum, and possibly more. But, the good
news, is that it appears that we are starting the Treaty, and will go back to it after the FY11 funding issues are resolved.
We will re-double our efforts to support the SRAP team
and do whatever you need in the coming days on
Af/Pak and beyond.

Dear Huma and Jake:
If there is an appropriate way to do so, I wondered if you might convey to Secretary Clinton how much it meant to me
personally and to so many of us that she led us last night for cathartic story-telling and laughter. It was such a terrible
evening, but she managed to ignite warmth at a moment when everything felt frozen still. Her ability to lift us all up
after a trip to Canada, hosting a huge reception, and on top of her own loss, was itself a rallying cry to soldier on the way
Holbrooke would have insisted we do. She helped fill the tremendous sense of void with funny memories and an
appreciation of how deeply he touched so many of us. I felt better by the time I left, and still do.
Many thanks,
Suzanne

Remarks of the Spokesman of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan about the
Sudden Death of Holbrooke.
According to credible news agencies of the world, the American president's Special Envoy for
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, died in George Washington's University hospital
at the age of 69. He had been suffering from a heart's disease for the past days.
Appointed on 22nd January 2009, as special envoy for Afghanistan/ Pakistan, Holbrooke was
keeping an eye on the Afghan issue. Some times ago, he told reporters that he had been passing
through a difficult phase of his life, exerting crippling and sapping pressure on him.
He passed out in his exclusive office for Afghanistan and regional affairs on Friday last,
following his above-mentioned reveals and his life of toils and fatigues ended after admission
into a hospital where he breathed his last yesterday.
The American rulers have not made any remarks about the cause of his sudden death in view of
the sensitivity of the issue but rumors have it that this giant of the American politics and
diplomacy became ill with a heart disease when his previous fame and credibility came under
question after the unremitting failures of the mission of Afghanistan and his facing the difficult
task. The protracted Afghan war and the descending trajectory of the Americans' handling of the
warfare in the country had had a lethal dent on Holbrook's health as a high-ranking American
official. He was grappling with a constant psychological stress.
Emergence of this untoward phenomenon as an off-shoot of the Afghan issue is not now a strange
thing. The same was the case with the former Soviet Union as the crisis touched its climax.
Former Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Konstantin Cherninkove and Vladimir
Andropov had heart attacks in a short time distance before the coming to scene of Michael
Gorbachove. They relieved themselves of the hard task of the Afghan mission by retreating into
the lap of death.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778404 Date: 08/31/2015
The recent symptoms are indicating that an outbreak of the same epidemic diseases has
started in the political and military echelons of America.
A few months ago, an American four stars general„ general David Peteraeus, fainted
during a senate hearing when he faced tough questions as regards the issue of
Afghanistan. The end of Holbrooke, the fate of general Mc Crystal and the defense
Secretary Robert Gate's warning to step down show that the war of Afghanistan is heavily
weighing down on the psyche of the American military and political high-ups. Some of them
lighten their burden by simply going to the other world and others, while being still alive, choose
to avoid shouldering the mission.
The sudden death of a high-ranking American diplomat happens in a time that American
strategists under the chair of Obama have been reviewing the issue of Afghanistan for the past
few days. They will expectedly announce their decision soon.
We believe Holbrooke's timely death could have a didactic effect on the American strategists,
teaching them many things to learn. In view of the American entanglement in the aggravating
swamp of Afghanistan, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan calls on the American powers-that-be
to abandon their dream of military domination and colonial sway in Afghanistan. Their
formulation of new military strategies will never change the imminent defeat into a victory in the
country. Still if they are bent on continuing with the status quo, they will face many unexpected
events and imbroglios. Their political and military circles will have to grapple with constant crisis
and untoward situations. Nothing more than that, they will achieve.

Dear all,
The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD - directorate under the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs) just published a new statement:
Report on Norwegian assistance to Grameen Bank
Norad submitted its report today on Norwegian support to
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in the 1980s and 1990s.
Minister of the Environment and International Development Erik
Solheim requested Norad to prepare the report after the Norwegian
television series ""Brennpunkt"" raised the question of where the
Norwegian aid money had gone.
Norad's report shows that Grameen Bank transferred a total of NOK
608.5 million to its sister company Grameen Kalyan in 1996.
Norway's share of this amount is estimated to be approximately
NOK 170 million. The Norwegian Embassy in Dhaka reacted
immediately when it discovered the transfer in 1997. In the
embassy's view, the transfer was not in accordance with the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778416 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778416 Date: 08/31/2015
agreement. The matter was raised with Grameen Bank. Following
negotiations, it was agreed in May 1998 that NOK 170 million was
to be transferred back from Grameen Kalyan to Grameen Bank.
""According to the report, there is no indication that Norwegian
funds have been used for unintended purposes, or that Grameen
Bank has engaged in corrupt practices or embezzled funds. The
matter was concluded when the agreement concerning
reimbursement of the funds was entered into in May 1998 under
the government in office at the time,"" said Mr Solheim.
The report will be made available in English at mfa.no as soon as
possible.

Clinton Seeks to Revamp Diplomacy, Development
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Filed at 11:26 a.m. EST
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday will unveil plans to restore civilian diplomacy and
development to its former role as the leading edge of American foreign policy.
Clinton is scheduled to present the results of a wide-ranging review of the operations of the State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development, conducted with the aim of better responding to global threats and emergencies. The proposed changes will
""give our military the partner it needs and deserves,"" according to an advance copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.
The plan calls for hiring 5,500 new personnel, creating new positions and the consolidating others under a revamped and streamlined
leadership structure.
The plan also outlines a strategy to reduce the government's reliance on private contractors, which has rapidly expanded over the past
decade, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.
""We will work to break down walls between agencies,"" Clinton wrote in an introduction. ""We will eliminate overlap, set priorities, and
fund only the work that supports those priorities. We will empower our people to make decisions and hold them accountable for the
results.""
No price tag is associated with the changes, which are being presented as a new Congress prepares to be seated next month. Many
Republicans, who are now the majority in the House, have called for deep spending cuts in the State Department and foreign operations
budgets. Moreover, one of Clinton's most powerful allies in efforts to boost civilian operations — Defense Secretary Robert Gates —
plans to leave his post sometime in the coming year.
In her introduction, Clinton said the goal is to ensure that the taxpayer dollar is spent wisely. ""It's an important exercise even in the best
economic times. In tough times, it's critical,"" she wrote.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778432 Date: 08/31/2015
The plan would set up bureaus for international energy affairs and crisis and conflict operations at State, as well as offices for policy
planning and science and technology at USAID. It would also add a special State Department cyber security coordinator and expand the
department's counterterrorism office.
More broadly, the review calls for giving greater authority to ambassadors and other senior diplomats abroad, making them the top
managers for implementing policy across all U.S. government agencies that have offices in their respective embassies or consulates.
""It sounds basic, but it's the kind of change that will help us tap the full potential of our civilian power,"" Clinton wrote.
The proposals grow out of the findings of a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review that Clinton ordered when she became
secretary of state, and reflects the Obama administration's ""smart power"" approach to foreign policy stressing civilian over military
operations.
The review is dedicated to the late Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat who died Monday.
""He represented the best of our nation's civilian power,"" it says. ""He understood that we cannot project our leadership unless we also
promote our values.""
The plan proposes expanding the existing undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs position to include civilian security
and human rights. The new crisis and conflict operations bureau would report to this official and coordinate civilian responses to
humanitarian emergencies with USAID.
At USAID,the proposal calls for tripling the hiring of midlevel workers from 30 to 95 per year to reduce reliance on outside contractors.
This aims to reverse the 38 percent decline in the agency's work force between 1990 and 2007.

HI Cheryl,
Thank you once again for the lift to Santo Domingo and for your support and friendship.
After our adventure last night, I had a delayed reaction to my good news. At the risk of sounding corny, I work
up this morning feeling glad to be alive, thankful for the privilege of working with smart, dedicated and
passionate people like you, and fortunate to live in a country with clean water, electricity, education, and
healthcare.
I hope that you, David and your kids have a happy, safe and healthy holiday season.
Warmly,

I am up in the middle of the night in Brussels and took a quick stab at stringing together some of the pieces of the ""moral
argument"". I am not sure how coherent it all is, (caveat lector) and don't want to confuse efforts to pull together talkers
for 5, but thought I'd share.
This could be boiled down further into key points (and the below is meant to stand on its own as an argument but not be
exclusive of others—re internet freedom and wikileaks, for example)
But I think it gets at some of what I think is missing...esp the bit at the end about the alternative---
D
1) Clear thinking demands avoiding simple analogies, or false syllogisms. Some have called WL
whistleblowing. Some have lauded it for contributing to transparency. But the comparison and inferences don't
hold up. Whistleblowing is when someone reveals an act of official wrongdoing, and because it is official
wrongdoing we assume that it's in the public interest to know about this and hold the culprits
accountable. Instead what WL is exposing, by and large, is a vast number of official acts of rightdoing-
diplomats engaged often with partners from other governments or civil society, in solving the kind of practical
problems that arise in a world made up of nearly two hundred nations. Many of the legitimate objectives of
these officials—whether securing dangerous materials or negotiating agreements that will advance good
governance and human rights—cannot be accomplished in a single conversation or interaction. Instead they are
long-term ongoing projects that require trust, tactical sequencing of interactions, and above all, confidence. It's
not the ultimate objectives that are confidential—indeed, they are quite public and leaders routinely outline
them in speeches, world peace, security, prosperity, etc. Rather it's simply the case that accomplishing good
objectives demands the kind of cooperative engagement that confidential relations permit, and so, while we can
and should maintain a general commitment to transparency, we also can and should recognize that a responsible
government that that is to be held accountable for delivering benefits for its people, will sometimes need to
work in confidence in order to do so. Whistleblowing exposes misconduct that runs counter to the interests of
citizens. Wikileaks undermines good conduct on behalf of citizens.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778445 Date: 08/31/2015
2) Absent a world government, it is the relations between states and peoples, whether through formal institutions
or everyday conversations and connections, that provides global governance. The formal relations between
states, made up of so many constellations of individual interactions, weave the fabric of a blanket of peace and
stability, one which creates a permissive environment in which states can live up to their responsibility to
provide for and protect people's rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR and other
documents international and domestic lay out the standards, but it is the quality of governance at both the
domestic and international levels that determines whether or not people enjoy those rights in their everyday
lives.
3) Some of those who are cheering Assange mistakenly believe that his action constitutes a speech act in a debate
about good governance—that his action constitutes a kind of critique, a demand for a particular kind of better
behavior. But it doesn't constitute a critique or a demand—this is not an exchange with another interlocutor
about a particular position or action. The exposure of 250,000 cables isn't a critique of any one of them; it's an
attempt to harm the medium itself—confidential communication among governments—rather than a rejection
of the messages. This isn't part of a particular debate, it's an action that undermines a key pillar of the system of
governance in which all debates can safely take place, in which individuals can, if they're lucky enough to live
in the kind of places that Assange has spent his life, make specific criticisms of the government, march, speak
out, protest, and do so with the protection of the rule of law.
4) In this specific case it is the communications of the United States that have been compromised. We regret the
embarrassment this has caused with some of our partners. We deplore the risk it has imposed on innocent
people on the frontlines of struggles against corruption or rights abuses around the world. But we are taking
steps to manage the consequences, address them, and to make future incidents less likely. But the attack on
legitimate confidential relations between governments is not an attack on the particular government in question,
it's an attack on the constellation of relationships and interactions referenced above, the informal agreements,
debates, discussions, etc through which governments around the world manage—imperfectly to be sure—to
work out their differences and find common ground and common cause; to maintain global order and stability
on which the security of their citizens and the citizens of other nations depends; to support and sustain the
commercial networks that can augment global prosperity; to do, in short, what citizens count on their
governments to do.
5) If wikileaks seeks to undermine this mode of international politics, it's not clear what it seeks to replace it
with. A world in which every step of climate negotiations were exposed in real time would not be more
prepared to confront the threat of climate change. A world in which every discussion among finance ministers
were immediately publicized would not have fewer financial crises. A world in which every discussion of how
to counter plots of terrorists or secure dangerous nuclear materials were on the front pages of the world's
newspapers would not be more safe.

Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R.
The mayor's company, 3loomber,
,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media
enterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an
agreement with the city to have no involvement in the ""day-to-day operations"" of his company, the endeavor, called
Bloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.
""I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the
values and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,"" said Matthew Winkler, the editor in
chief of Bloomberg News. ""I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to
come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.""
The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet
another potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that
collide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.
Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has
a direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not
avoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.
Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time
to time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.
""I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,"" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasional
involvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at
arm's length from the company.
A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.
""Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,"" he said.
As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial
page is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for
president.)
The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg
Businessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and
businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of
state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.
Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,
the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in
the blogosphere.
But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two
years ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.
For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an
editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.
The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old
one in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.
Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed
editorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.
""He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,"" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City
University of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. ""This is what we all do. We try to persuade the
rest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.""
Mr. Winkler said: ""There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally
seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with
reporting.""
""That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the
company, that it should take advantage of,"" Mr. Winkler added.
Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of
accomplishment.
Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that
will eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government
services and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778447 Date: 08/31/2015

BERLIN (AP) - Germany's foreign minister is playing down the country's expectations for Afghanistan's future while
reiterating that German troops will start their withdrawal by the end of next year as planned. Guido Westerwelle told
parliament December 16 that after nearly a decade in Afghanistan, Germany has ""more realistic expectations"" for the
country, saying that Berlin is no longer expecting good governance but the more achievable goal of ""good-enough
governance."" Westerwelle says German troops will start withdrawing as planned in late 2011 and start handing over the
responsibility to Afghan authorities by the middle of next year. He says the last of Germany's current 4,600 troops are to
leave by 2014, saying the withdrawal must not endanger allied troops or leave the country in the hands of the Taliban.

RAMALLAH (AP) - Palestinian negotiators are for the first time asking European countries to recognize a Palestinian state
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even without a peace deal with Israel. The move is part of growing Palestinian
campaign to pursue statehood outside of peace talks with Israel, which have been deadlocked since
September. Palestinian officials say they asked the consuls general of France, Britain, Sweden and Denmark as well as
the European Union envoy to the peace process to recognize the 1967 borders between Israel and ""Palestine."" The EU
says it will recognize a Palestinian state ""when appropriate,"" but that negotiations are the only way to peace.

Richard Holbrooke, Pakistan's hero:
He had a vision for our future
New York Daily News.
By Ahmed Rashid <http://www.nydailynews.com/authors/Ahmed%20Rashid> Wednesday, December 15th 2010, 4:00
AM
•No American has tried as hard to ease the fears, apprehensions, doubts, conspiracy theories and ill-informed views of
Pakistanis toward the U.S. <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/United+States> as has Richard Holbrooke
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Richard+Holbrooke>. His death is a tragedy for American diplomacy - but much
more so for Pakistan <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pakistan>, because whether you liked him or disliked him,
there is no denying that in the last two years, he constantly battled for Pakistan.
The image of Holbrooke wading through floodwater, distributing relief goods to this year's 20 million flood victims - not
once but repeatedly at the ripe age of 69 - is an indelible one, that our own much younger leaders barely ever
replicated. He pushed for U.S. helicopters to be deployed in Pakistan for the flood victims. He pushed for more aid
money for Pakistan from a reluctant Congress.
He helped start a dialogue on a dozen different issues - which will be his lasting legacy - and he pushed Pakistan,
especially its army, to change its ways. Under the proverbial cover of national interest, we Pakistanis never made life
easier for him or for ourselves by confronting the new realities of terrorism, our lack of political leadership or our
collapsing economy.
But Holbrooke soldiered on.

At times he may have been aggressive and pushy, loud and boisterous, too quintessentially American, too bluntly New
York <http://www.nydailvnews.com/topics/New+York>.
But ultimately none of that mattered, because he bought to the table for the first time - after the preferred ignorance of
the Bush administration and its lackadaisical love affair with Gen. Pervez Musharraf
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pervez+Musharraf> - a strategic vision to the U.S.-Pakistan relationship.
What was this vision? That America would remain committed to Pakistan's progress over the long term, even after the
Afghanistan <http://www.nvdaiIvnews.com/topics/Afghanistan> war was over, and that it would help improve Pakistani
relations with India <http://www.nyclailynews.comitopics/Ind ia> .
This was crucial: Unlike many who came before him and will come after, Holbrooke thought Pakistan was important for
its own sake, not just because America wanted to defeat the Taliban
<http://www.nydailynews.cornitopics/The+Taliban> in Afghanistan or solidify trade relationships with India.
He recognized the deep feelings of mistrust and ambivalence that still exist in Pakistan toward the U. S. He knew better
than anyone in the U.S. administration that diplomacy makes a difference when diplomats deal with the realities on the
ground - and not a preconceived image of what should be.
We should remember that all this time, Holbrooke battled the odds back in Washington
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Washington%2c+DC> . The Obama administration
<http://www.nyclailynews.comitopics/Barack+Obama> was and is heavily divided between the Obama-controlled
White House <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+White+House> , the Hillary Clinton
<http://www.nydailynews.comitopics/Hillary+Clinton> -controlled State Department
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/U.S.+Department+of+State> - in which he was her key adviser on global issues -
and the all-powerful Pentagon. Not to speak of a Congress that, even when Democratic-controlled, kept trying to put
awkward strings on aid to Pakistan, which Holbrooke opposed.
Holbrooke was a pain in the rear end for many of these power centers. At times he was ignored by the White House or
by the Pentagon <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+Pentagon> . At other times he was castigated by Congress.
But Holbrooke, a strong-willed man, stuck to his convictions.
Whoever comes after him will be far less likely to have that strength of character - call it pigheadedness, if you like - and
that will be a great loss.
It is especially problematic as Pakistan's future continues to teeter. The military still gives sanctuary to the Taliban.
Extremism is still spreading. The international community still raises fears about the safety of its nuclear weapons. As
the end game in Afghanistan approaches, some in Pakistan are pressuring against a final settlement of hostilities there.
Some in America will be happy to have a thorn removed from their sides. But many Pakistanis will remember Richard
Holbrooke fondly: He was tirelessly fighting for a more stable future for our country. We have lost a friend, and whoever
replaces him will never quite measure up.

Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg
Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died,"" she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this
sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about
him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate ""in your face"" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw
voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)
and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for
danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He
was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular
wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.
Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him
in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a ""source,"" a prolific and forceful writer whose
favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was
gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the
New York Public Library's ""Literary Lions"" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on
his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.
At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.
Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him
if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song ""The Envoy."" He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After
that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he
needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.
If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the
Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more
positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken
heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that
brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be
the most important he ever spoke.

Richard Holbrooke was a piece of work. He was a paradoxical man: a remarkably subtle thinker capable of the
most egregious lack of subtlety, a brilliant diplomat with one of the least diplomatic temperaments anybody
ever encountered. He was always cunning but never malevolent. Mentally, he was sleepless, relentlessly
pondering the meanings of even the most trivial events and experiences. An example: Decades ago Holbrooke
was strolling down Madison Avenue with a friend. .A man passed them and said ""Hi, Dick"". Holbrook.e stopped
in his tracks, turned to his friend, and said: ""I wonder what he meant by that."" Sleepless.) His powers of
observation were extraordinary, the cognitive advantage of his utter extroversion; and they were matched by his
massive powers of analysis, which never shut down. He was a disorderly man with an ordered mind; there was
rigorous reflection at the heart of the Whirlwind. He was, almost preposterously, in constant motion. a stranger
to cairn, a bull in search of a china shop; but in his thinking, and in his commitment to his country, he was one
of the steadiest men on earth.

The legend of his career, and the flamboyance of his person, has obscured a proper recognition of his
commitments. Holbrooke was not only a student of power; he was also a creature of beliefs. What he believed
in most of all, I think, was in the ability, and the duty, of the United States, by a variety of means, to better the
world.. He was, in his cast of mind., a realist, but his cast of mind was not his philosophy: this realist—the
Democrats' most accomplished Machiavellian--was always returning to first principles, to moral
considerations, to the alleviation of human suffering and the spread of political liberty as goals of American
statecraft. He came away. from his early years in Vietnam with lessons but without a syndrome. He was
unanguished about the use of American force, when it was morally justified and intelligently applied—which is
to say, he was the last of the postwar liberals. Even in his most virulent criticism of what he regarded as
America's military mistakes abroad, there was not a trace of the temptation to surrender a high sense of
America's role in history. Isolationism disgusted him. He had a natural understanding, it was almost an attribute
of his character, of the relationship between diplomacy and force. He had no illusions about the harshness of the
world, arid therefore about the toughness that is required for the creation of a world less harsh. His last
assignment, the increasingly Sisyphean attempt to bring Afghanistan into the community of open and. decent
societies, was a bet on this sober and unsentimental optimism. He cared famously about what worked, and he
could be brazen in his pragmatism, but Holbrook& s professional life was animated by goals and concepts that
no mere pragmatist could share. American interventionism, for him, was not just a policy; it was a way of
existing responsibly in the world, the measure of a national (and personal) ideal, the real greatness of a great
power.
It was this rare package of means and ends, of ideas and instruments, that made possible Holbrooke's triumph at
Dayton. He negotiated a peace with a villain whom he deeply despised, and thereby ended a genocide in which
W(, the United States, and an administration from his own party, had outrageously acquiesced. In this way hie
helped to restore the honor of his country after a period of disgrace. On the day that Holbrooke suffered the
cataclysmic collapse from which he never recovered, The New York Times reported that Henry Kissinger—the
Republicans' most accomplished. Machiavellian—remarked in 1973 that ""if they put Jews into gas chambers in
the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern."" Such unforgettably filthy
words would never have crossed Richard Holbrooke's lips. In government and out, not least in his
groundbreaking work at Refugees international, his career was a loud and effective refutation of that chilling
""maybe.""
He was also an intellectual. He edited, he wrote (for my pages, too), he read. He raised a lasting institution of
intellectuality in the American Academy in Berlin. His renowned attraction to journalists was not just a more or
less charming campaign of spin; in his unslakable desire for the latest news and the immediate interpretation of
it, he was one of their company. There was so much about which. this genuinely cosmopolitan 1-lan did not need
to be briefed. He had an appetite for complexity, though it never crippled him in his practice. it was Holbrook.e,
more than anybody else, NA1110 fbctised American planning upon the most disturbing contemporary complexity of
all: the grim fact that the pursuit of our national security in Central Asia depends as much, if not mole, upon
Pakistan than upon Afghanistan. And after he edited and wrote and read, and before, and during, he talked.
Holbrooke's talk was a kind of rolling chronicle of his times, a rush of concepts and gossip, brash, probing,
lin-patient, occasionally outrageous, with a fine feeling for absurdity in the mix—the richest display of his
prodigious vitality. He was faster on his feet than anybody I have ever known. it was a joy, and an amusement,
to behold.
We were friends for almost three decades. He was a constant source of fascination--I had never before
encountered such a union of iMrigue and idealism; but mostly he inspired admiration and affection. Now th.e
unstoppable man has been stopped, and the man who was everywhere is nowhere. If only he could have gotten
the angel of death around a table....

Sen. Ron Wyden Has Early Stage Prostate Cancer, Will Miss Votes
Posted Thursday, December 16, 2010 5:06 PM I By David Weigel
Here is the statement -- Wyden caught the cancer early, but will have to miss votes tomorrow and
next week.
After my annual physical in late November, I was diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer. After reviewing all
the options with multiple physicians, I decided to take a proactive approach and have surgery, which will be
performed December 20 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Alan Partin.
Thanks to routine screening, this was diagnosed very early and I expect a full and speedy recovery.
I scheduled the surgery for the Monday before Christmas anticipating that the Senate would have recessed by
that time and that there would be no disruption to my work in Oregon or Washington. However, it now appears
that I will be missing votes tomorrow and possibly next week while I prepare and undergo this procedure. I
expect to be back to work full-time when the Senate reconvenes in January.
If anything is taken away from my experience, I hope it is the importance of getting routine physicals. One in six
men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes. Early detection is critical to catching this
disease when treatment is most effective.
Wyden's vote is one Democrats are counting on for tough votes; he's needed to pass the START treaty, the omnibus, and
possibly the DREAM Act. According to current vote counts, it would be possible for the Senate to repeal DADT without
Wyden's vote -- with the support of key Republicans, vote counters say they're at 61 or 62.

Richard Holbrooke was a piece of work. He was a paradoxical man: a remarkably subtle thinker capable of the most
egregious lack of subtlety, a brilliant diplomat with one of the least diplomatic temperaments anybody ever
encountered. He was always cunning but never malevolent. Mentally, he was sleepless, relentlessly pondering the
meanings of even the most trivial events and experiences. (An example: Decades ago Holbrooke was strolling down
Madison Avenue with a friend. A man passed them and said ""Hi, Dick"". Holbrooke stopped in his tracks, turned to his
friend, and said: ""I wonder what he meant by that."" Sleepless.) His powers of observation were extraordinary, the
cognitive advantage of his utter extroversion; and they were matched by his massive powers of analysis, which never
shut down. He was a disorderly man with an ordered mind; there was rigorous reflection at the heart of the whirlwind.
He was, almost preposterously, in constant motion, a stranger to calm, a bull in search of a china shop; but in his
thinking, and in his commitment to his country, he was one of the steadiest men on earth.
The legend of his career, and the flamboyance of his person, has obscured a proper recognition of his commitments.
Holbrooke was not only a student of power; he was also a creature of beliefs. What he believed in most of all, I think,
was in the ability, and the duty, of the United States, by a variety of means, to better the world. He was, in his cast of
mind, a realist, but his cast of mind was not his philosophy: this realist—the Democrats' most accomplished
Machiavellian—was always returning to first principles, to moral considerations, to the alleviation of human suffering
and the spread of political liberty as goals of American statecraft. He came away from his early years in Vietnam with
lessons but without a syndrome. He was unanguished about the use of American force, when it was morally justified and
intelligently applied—which is to say, he was the last of the postwar liberals. Even in his most virulent criticism of what
he regarded as America's military mistakes abroad, there was not a trace of the temptation to surrender a high sense of
America's role in history. Isolationism disgusted him. He had a natural understanding, it was almost an attribute of his
character, of the relationship between diplomacy and force. He had no illusions about the harshness of the world, and
therefore about the toughness that is required for the creation of a world less harsh. His last assignment, the
increasingly Sisyphean attempt to bring Afghanistan into the community of open and decent societies, was a bet on this
sober and unsentimental optimism. He cared famously about what worked, and he could be brazen in his pragmatism,
but Holbrooke's professional life was animated by goals and concepts that no mere pragmatist could share. American
interventionism, for him, was not just a policy; it was a way of existing responsibly in the world, the measure of a
national (and personal) ideal, the real greatness of a great power.
It was this rare package of means and ends, of ideas and instruments, that made possible Holbrooke's triumph at
Dayton. He negotiated a peace with a villain whom he deeply despised, and thereby ended a genocide in which we, the
United States, and an administration from his own party, had outrageously acquiesced. In this way he helped to restore
the honor of his country after a period of disgrace. On the day that Holbrooke suffered the cataclysmic collapse from
which he never recovered, The New York Times reported that Henry Kissinger—the Republicans' most accomplished
Machiavellian—remarked in 1973 that ""if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American
concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern."" Such unforgettably filthy words would never have crossed Richard
Holbrooke's lips. In government and out, not least in his groundbreaking work at Refugees International, his career was
a loud and effective refutation of that chilling ""maybe.""
He was also an intellectual. He edited, he wrote (for my pages, too), he read. He raised a lasting institution of
intellectuality in the American Academy in Berlin. His renowned attraction to journalists was not just a more or less
charming campaign of spin; in his unslakable desire for the latest news and the immediate interpretation of it, he was
one of their company. There was so much about which this genuinely cosmopolitan man did not need to be briefed. He
had an appetite for complexity, though it never crippled him in his practice. It was Holbrooke, more than anybody else,
who focused American planning upon the most disturbing contemporary complexity of all: the grim fact that the pursuit
of our national security in Central Asia depends as much, if not more, upon Pakistan than upon Afghanistan. And after he
edited and wrote and read, and before, and during, he talked. Holbrooke's talk was a kind of rolling chronicle of his
times, a rush of concepts and gossip, brash, probing, impatient, occasionally outrageous, with a fine feeling for absurdity

in the mix—the richest display of his prodigious vitality. He was faster on his feet than anybody I have ever known. It was
a joy, and an amusement, to behold.
We were friends for almost three decades. He was a constant source of fascination-1 had never before encountered
such a union of intrigue and idealism; but mostly he inspired admiration and affection. Now the unstoppable man has
been stopped, and the man who was everywhere is nowhere. If only he could have gotten the angel of death around a
table....

Madam Secretary,
The outpouring of condolences from the international community and the Afghans for Richard's passing has been
extraordinary. We have had a steady flow of visitors from the NATO and diplomatic community and, most importantly,
Afghans of every walk of life for several days who have come to sign the condolence book.
Today, during my weekly meeting with President Karzai, I took along the condolence book to be signed at the
Palace. President Karzai signed and wrote a nice tribute to Richard and graciously allowed us to bring an Embassy
photographer to memorialize the occasion. A photograph is attached. We will separately arrange for a copy to be
signed by President Karzai for Kati.
Separately, I would ask that you thank Mike Mullen for permitting the USO show with which he is traveling to stage an
unprecedented performance at the U.S. Embassy today. Allowing Embassy Kabul to be the site of a USO show in
Afghanistan was very gracious of Mike as normally USO shows are only held at military bases. We had an extraordinary
turnout of our civilian and military team from all over Kabul gathered today to see Robin Williams and other
entertainers. Mike remains a real champion of our civil-military cooperation and teamwork.
Respectfully,
Karl
SBU
